- **Conditional Tags** are now live in `BETA`!
  - Add a condition to a tag so that it is only added to a page/component/element if that condition is met.
  - Perfect for styles that you want to add/remove dynamically.

- You can now **Copy/Paste components and pages between different Embeddables**!
  - Use `Ctrl/Cmd + C` to copy a component, then `Ctrl/Cmd + V` to paste it in another embeddable.
    - This works with containers - it will copy all child components along with it.
    - You can also use the Copy button in the Options card.
    - This will copy across the structure **without styles**.
  - You can also **copy with styles included** using the "Copy with Styles" button in the Options card.
    - This will bring all the styles associated with the applied tags.
    - If any conflict occurs you will be asked to choose whether to replace tag styles or keep them.
