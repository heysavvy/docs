## Monday 29 January, 2024

- **üî• Features and Updates:**
  - üß™ **Split Testing v2** This complete rebuild of our Experiments feature makes it easy and simple to do the following:
    - Create new experiments.
    - Pause experiments, selecting a temporary winner\*.
    - Complete experiments, choosing a winner\* - this will automatically remove conditions as well as losing pages and components that are no longer used.
    - Add variants and edit variant weights.
    - Easily add experiment-related conditions to components.
    - Get a preview link for your experiment with the variant you choose, so you can test out that variant as a user.
    - View which pages + components are related to a particular experiment variant - these are color-coded, both in the preview and in the Layers card.
    - See a list of past completed experiments, when they were completed, and (for new experiments\*) which variant won.

<Info>
  *Note that this only applies to experiments created in Split Testing v2. Older
  experiments can't be paused or completed in the same way.
