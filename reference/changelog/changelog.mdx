## Thursday 25 January, 2024

- **üî• Features and Updates:**

  - When you add a new component, it will now be automatically selected.
  - When building with ChatMessages components, you can now select which
    GPT model to use. (Currently [`JSON-Only`](/reference/glossary/glossary#json-only-feature) for now)

- **‚ö°Ô∏è Improvements:**
  - Re-rendering of pages and components is more efficient, making the builder
    faster to work with.
  - Initial rendering of embeddables now fills templates with data (e.g. default
    userData & external content) for certain component types, which should lead to
    faster load times and better Google Lighthouse scores.
- **üêû Bug fixes:**
  - The Pages card no longer sometimes plays videos or loads iframes in the background.
  - The ChatMessages component no longer fails to work if "Handle AI Messages" is not checked.

- **üî• Features and Updates:**
  - **Conditional Tags** are now live in `BETA`!

- **üî• Features and Updates:**
  - You can now **Copy/Paste components and pages between different Embeddables**!
    - Use `Ctrl/Cmd + C` to copy a component, then `Ctrl/Cmd + V` to paste it in another embeddable.
      - This works with containers - it will copy all child components along with it.
      - You can also use the Copy button in the Options card.
      - This will copy across the structure **without styles**.
    - You can also **copy with styles included** using the "Copy with Styles" button in the Options card.
      - This will bring all the styles associated with the applied tags.
      - If any conflict occurs you will be asked to choose whether to replace tag styles or keep them.
