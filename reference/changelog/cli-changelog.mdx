<Update label="v0.7.19 — 23 February 2026">

### Bug Fixes

- **`embeddables dev` no longer loops when fixing duplicate option IDs** — Fixed an infinite rebuild loop in dev mode triggered when an `OptionSelector` had duplicate button IDs. The fix routine now uses targeted text replacements instead of full Babel code generation, so files are only written when content actually changes. Duplicate ID detection also now covers const-referenced button arrays (e.g. `buttons={someButtons}`), not just inline arrays.
- **TypeScript: `props` property now included in generated component types** — The `Props<T>` type emitted into `.types/components.d.ts` by `embeddables init` was missing a `props` field, causing errors like `Property 'props' does not exist on type 'Props<FileUpload>'`. A `props?: Record<string, any>` property is now included.
- **`embeddables init` no longer duplicates `.gitignore` entries** — Running `embeddables init` more than once used to append a new `# Embeddables` block each time. It now replaces the existing block in-place. The generated block also adds `node_modules/` and no longer unnecessarily includes `**/.types/`.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.18 — 22 February 2026">

### Features

- **Multi-language support** — The CLI now correctly handles Embeddables with multi-language content, converting between `data-<language>-<property>` in the JSON and the `languages` property in React.

### Chores

- **CI: GitHub token updated in publish workflow** — Internal publish workflow updated to use the correct GitHub token reference.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.17 — 22 February 2026">

### Improvements

- **`embeddables pull` defaults to latest version** — Running `embeddables pull` without `--version` now pulls the latest version automatically, skipping the version-selection prompt. To choose a version interactively, use `embeddables pull --version`; to pull a specific version, pass a number: `embeddables pull --version 47`.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.16 — 22 February 2026">

### Bug Fixes

- **Reverse compiler: global component cross-location `parent_id`** — Fixed a round-trip bug where a global component with `_location` pointing to one group (e.g. `before_components`) but `parent_id` pointing to a component in a different location group (e.g. `before_page`) was orphaned during reverse compilation. Components are now grouped by following their parent chain rather than their own `_location`, keeping the component tree intact in a single TSX file.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.15 — 22 February 2026">

### Features

- **`embeddables builder open`** — Opens the Embeddables Builder in your default browser for the selected Embeddable. Resolves the project from `embeddables.json` (or prompts to select one if not configured), then navigates directly to the edit URL. Pass `-i <id>` to skip the interactive prompt, or run from inside `embeddables/<id>/` to infer the Embeddable automatically.
- **`embeddables inspect`** — New debugging command that fetches an Embeddable by ID from the engine, reverse-compiles it to React/CSS/JS files, rebuilds it back to JSON, and reports which top-level keys differ between the original and rebuilt output. Designed for diagnosing round-trip compiler bugs.

### Chores

- **CI workflow improvements** — Internal documentation update workflow enhanced with version input, updated permission modes, and improved branch/trigger configuration.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.14 — 22 February 2026">

### Features

- **Codex (AGENTS.md) support** — `embeddables init` now generates an `AGENTS.md` file at the project root, following the OpenAI Codex convention. This gives Codex the same Embeddables CLI context that Cursor and Claude already receive.

### Bug Fixes

- **Condition `id` now required** — The `id` field on conditions is now required (previously optional). Use the `cond_` prefix + 10 digits format (e.g. `cond_1234567890`), consistent with other ID conventions. Existing conditions without IDs will need one added.
- **Case-insensitive sorting in CLI lists** — Lists of embeddables, projects, and experiments shown in interactive prompts now sort case-insensitively using `localeCompare`. Previously, uppercase names (e.g. "CLI") could sort before lowercase ones (e.g. "count").

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.13 — 22 February 2026">

### Bug Fixes

- **Compiler: dataOutputs no longer dropped** — Fixed a bug where `dataOutputs` (including webhook actions) were removed from the compiled output when the `actions/` directory didn't exist or contained no JS files. The compiler now preserves webhook actions from the config even when there are no local JS action files.
- **Compiler: improved JSX string escaping** — Strings containing backslashes, newlines, and double quotes are now escaped correctly when generating JSX attributes, preventing double-escaping and malformed output during round-trips.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.12 — 20 February 2026">

### Improvements

- **Archived Embeddables excluded from lists** — Archived Embeddables no longer appear in the interactive selection prompt when running `embeddables pull` or `embeddables dev`, keeping your lists clean and focused.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.10 — 20 February 2026">

### Features

- **Local Embeddables prioritized in selection** — When choosing an Embeddable to work with, locally-pulled Embeddables are now shown at the top of the list.
- **`embeddables init` cleans up `.claudefiles`** — If an old `.claudefiles` directory exists from a previous version of the CLI, `init` will now remove it and replace it with the correctly named `.claude/` directory.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.9 — 20 February 2026">

### Features

- **`pull --version <number>`** — You can now pull a specific saved version of an Embeddable: `embeddables pull --version 47`. Useful for checking out an older version or recovering from a bad save.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.7 — 19 February 2026">

### Features

- **Login required for all commands** — The CLI now enforces authentication before running commands that require it (pull, dev, save, etc.). You'll see a clear prompt to log in (`embeddables login`) rather than a cryptic API error.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.6 — 19 February 2026">

### Bug Fixes

- **CMS dev mode: `content_sources` omitted** — Fixed a proxy issue where `content_sources` was incorrectly included in dev mode for CMS-based Embeddables, causing unexpected behaviour. It is now correctly omitted during local development.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.5 — 19 February 2026">

### Bug Fixes

- **Workbench: page selector fixed** — The page selector in the Workbench panel was not working; it is now functional again.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.4 — 19 February 2026">

### Improvements

- **Workbench keyboard shortcut updated** — The Workbench toggle shortcut is now `⌥K` (Option+K on Mac).

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.3 — 19 February 2026">

### Bug Fixes

- **Reverse compiler: `CustomHTML` uses `class` not `className`** — When reverse-compiling an Embeddable to TSX, `CustomHTML` components now correctly generate `class` (HTML attribute) instead of `className` (React attribute) in their raw HTML content.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.7.0 — 19 February 2026">

### Features

- **Structured error logging via Sentry** — The CLI now reports errors to Sentry for improved diagnostics. Logs include context about which command was run, making it easier to debug failures.
- **`.claude/` directory** — The Claude project context directory is now named `.claude/` (previously `.claudefiles/`). Running `embeddables init` will create the correct directory. If you have an old `.claudefiles/` directory, run `embeddables init` to migrate.

### Bug Fixes

- **Build errors handled gracefully** — The CLI now exits cleanly with a helpful message on certain build errors instead of crashing with an unhandled exception.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.6.11 — 18 February 2026">

### Improvements

- **Branch state persisted from config** — `embeddables pull` now reads and restores the active branch from `config.json`, so the CLI stays on the correct branch across sessions without needing `-b` each time.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.6.9 — 18 February 2026">

### Features

- **Workbench shown/hidden via query parameter** — The Workbench debugging panel can now be toggled with `?workbench=true` / `?workbench=false` in the preview URL, without restarting the dev server.
- **Custom validation functions in compiled output** — Components with a `custom_validation_function` now compile that logic correctly into the output, based on `validation_formula` presence.
- **Edit history tracking in save** — `embeddables save` now includes edit history metadata when uploading, improving version tracking in the Builder.

### Bug Fixes

- **`class` vs `className` in CustomHTML** — Fixed a reverse-compiler bug where `class` attributes inside `CustomHTML` were converted to `className`. Raw HTML attributes in custom HTML blocks are now left as-is.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.6.8 — 18 February 2026">

### Features

- **`pull --preserve`** — New flag to keep the existing component order in `config.json` when pulling. Most first-pull "changes" are React reordering components within containers—`--preserve` prevents that noise so you can focus on real differences. See the [CLI reference](/cli#pull-preserve) for details.
- **Metadata-only actions preserved** — Actions that carry only metadata (no JS logic) are now correctly included in the compiled output.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.6.5 – v0.6.7 — 17–18 February 2026">

### Features

- **`embeddables upgrade` command** — New command to update the CLI to the latest stable version: `embeddables upgrade`. No need to remember the full `npm install -g @embeddables/cli` command.
- **`embeddables -v` shows package version** — The version flag now reads directly from `package.json`, so it always reflects the installed package version.
- **Custom validation functions compiled to TypeScript** — Components with custom validation logic are now reverse-compiled into typed TypeScript functions, improving editor support and type safety.

### Bug Fixes

- **Template literal escaping in button text** — Strings containing `${{ ... }}` (Embeddables template syntax) in button text are no longer accidentally treated as JavaScript template literal interpolations during reverse compilation.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.6.1 — 16 February 2026">

### Features

- **`--fix` flag for lint auto-correction** — Pass `--fix` to `embeddables build`, `embeddables dev`, or `embeddables pull` to automatically fix common issues: duplicate IDs, duplicate keys, and keys that start with a digit.

### Bug Fixes

- **Proxy error handling improved** — The dev proxy server now handles connection errors more gracefully, with clearer error messages when the Engine is unreachable.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.6.0 — 15 February 2026">

### Features

- **Branch management in pull and save** — `embeddables pull` and `embeddables save` now handle branch metadata automatically, reading and writing the active branch to `config.json`.
- **`parent_key` deprecation handled** — The reverse compiler now detects and strips deprecated `parent_key` usage, replacing it with the correct `parent_id`-based approach.

</Update>
