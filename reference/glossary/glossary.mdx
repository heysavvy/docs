#### Embeddables vs embeddables

Embeddables (capital `E`) is the name of our company and product!

To differentiate from this, embeddables (lowercase `e`) is what we
write when talking about the things that you **_build_** in our platform.

So you build, embed and push live an embeddable. And you do so using the product Embeddables.

Enjoy building embeddables in Embeddables!

#### End-User

_Note: Also known as a [Contact](#contact)._

This is a real life person who is currently viewing/completing, or has previously viewed/completed, one of your embeddables.

This is distinct from an Embeddables User, which is someone who builds embeddables in our builder - like you!

#### User Data

_Note: Also known as an [Entry](#entry)._

This is the set of data that an [end-user](#end-user) of an embeddable has at any time, for example their email address or the answer they gave to a question.

It is stored in `JSON` format and the schema is dependent on the embeddable that they are using.

A user that has taken multiple embeddables will have a different User Data for each one. In our database, this is known as one [Contact](#contact) corresponding to multiple [Entries](#entry).
