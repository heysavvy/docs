#### Embeddables vs embeddables

Embeddables (capital `E`) is the name of our company and product!

To differentiate from this, embeddables (lowercase `e`) is what we
write when talking about the things that you **_build_** in our platform.

So you build, embed and push live an Embeddable. And you do so using the product Embeddables.

Enjoy building embeddables in Embeddables!

#### End-User

_Note: Also known as a [Contact](#contact)._

This is a real life person who is currently viewing/completing, or has previously viewed/completed, one of your embeddables.

This is distinct from an Embeddables User, which is someone who builds embeddables in our builder - like you!

#### Entry

See: [User Data](#user-data)

---

#### Group

A Group corresponds to a billing account with Embeddables.

If you are a customer of Embeddables that you would typically have a single Group in our system.

Groups can contain multiple [Projects](#project).

---

#### JSON-Only Feature

These are new features in the Builder, which are available for use but don't yet have
buttons/inputs in the Builder cards to be able to add/modify them.

**Advanced users only:** If you want to use these features in the meantime, you can
edit the JSON of the component/page/Embeddable to add/update the feature manually.

---

#### Project

Each project is a collection of embeddables, to help you organize them into different... well, projects!

Your various Projects are all associated with your [Group](#group).

If an [End-User](#end-user) who visits multiple embeddables that are all within the same Project, they will have multiple Entries grouped within a single Contact.

On the other hand, if an End User visits multiple embeddables that span several Projects (even if they are in the same Group), this will create multiple Contacts.

---

#### User Data

_Note: Also known as an [Entry](#entry)._

This is the set of data that an [end-user](#end-user) of an Embeddable has at any time, for example their email address or the answer they gave to a question.

It is stored in `JSON` format and the schema is dependent on the Embeddable that they are using.

A user that has taken multiple embeddables will have a different User Data for each one. In our database, this is known as one [Contact](#contact) corresponding to multiple [Entries](#entry).
