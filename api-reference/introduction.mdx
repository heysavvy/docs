## Authentication

All private API endpoints are authenticated using API Keys.

Each API Key gives full access to a particular [Project](/reference/glossary/glossary#project).

Head to **Settings** > **Credentials and Endpoints** in the [Embeddables Dashboard](https://app.embeddables.com/) to create an API Key.

You should provide the API Key as the `X-Api-Key` header in your request:

```sh Sample CURL Request
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.embeddables.com/projects/{projectId}/entries \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: <x-api-key>'
```
