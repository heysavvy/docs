## Overview

Publishing your Embeddable via a reverse proxy can be done in 2 steps:

1. Point your page to our proxy server (`https://proxy.embeddables.com`)
2. Pass the `X-Embeddables-Id` header with the correct Embeddable ID

## Advantages of using a reverse proxy

- **Simplicity**: Unlike embedding in your site via our embed code, there is no need to set up a blank page on your site to host the Embeddable.
- **Speed**: The Embeddable rendered directly from our proxy server, so the extra client-side fetch from our embed code is skipped.

## Setting up a reverse proxy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Point your page to our proxy server">
    Configure your reverse proxy to point to `https://proxy.embeddables.com`. This is the main endpoint that will serve your embeddable content.
    
    For example, in Nginx:
    ```nginx
    location /your-reverse-proxy-page {
        proxy_pass https://proxy.embeddables.com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify the proxy is pointing to the correct page">
    Visit `https://yourdomain.com/your-reverse-proxy-page` in your browser. You should see content similar to what appears on `https://proxy.embeddables.com`.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pass the correct embeddable ID">
    Add the `X-Embeddables-Id` header to your proxy configuration. This header tells the proxy which specific embeddable to serve.
    
    In Nginx, add this to your configuration:
    ```nginx
    proxy_set_header X-Embeddables-Id "your_embeddable_id";
    ```
    
    In Apache:
    ```apache
    RequestHeader set X-Embeddables-Id "your_embeddable_id"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify that it's working">
    Refresh your page at `https://yourdomain.com/your-reverse-proxy-page`. You should now see your specific embeddable being served.
    
    Common issues at this stage:
    - Incorrect embeddable ID
    - Missing or malformed headers
    - Caching issues (try clearing your browser cache)
    - Propagation time (try waiting a few minutes)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Configurations

### Apache

```apache
<Location "/your-reverse-proxy-page">
    ProxyPass https://proxy.embeddables.com
    ProxyPassReverse https://proxy.embeddables.com
    RequestHeader set X-Embeddables-Id "your_embeddable_id"
</Location>
```

### Nginx

```nginx
location /your-reverse-proxy-page {
    proxy_pass https://proxy.embeddables.com;
    proxy_set_header X-Embeddables-Id "your_embeddable_id";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

## Common Issues

1. **Content Not Loading**
    - Verify your reverse proxy configuration.
    - Check that the `X-Embeddables-Id` header is correctly set.
    - Check that the Embeddable you're trying to access has been **pushed to production**.
      - If not, then you'll need to add the `?savvy_flow_version=latest` query parameter to the URL to preview the latest version.
    - Ensure your domain's SSL certificate is valid.
    - Clear your browser cache.
    - Wait a few minutes for propagation to take effect.

2. **Wrong Content Appearing**
    - Double-check the embeddable ID.
    - Verify the proxy_pass URL is correct.
    - Clear your browser cache.
