## Use-cases

Some common use-cases that we often see:

1. I want to prefill data like email addresses into my embeddable that users have already entered previously on my site.
2. I want to prefill data from my embeddable into an embedded component inside it, like a Calendly booker or Stripe component.
3. I want to pass data like email addresses out of my embeddable to be used on a subsequent page on my website.

<Note>
This doc is for passing data to be immediately prefilled somewhere in front of the user.

For ways of sending/receiving the data to/from an external source like an API, database or SaaS app, check out [How To: Decide how to send/receive data](/how-to/decide-how-to-send-data)

## Passing data into an embeddable to prefill fields (e.g. email address)

### Method 1: URL params

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the fields into the URL as params">
    - For example: `https://mywebsite.com/onboarding?email=ada@lovelace.com`.
    - Make sure that this is the URL when the embeddable first loads,
      since that's when it will look for URL params.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set those fields to be URL-controlled">
    - Head to the embeddable-wide settings
    - Go to the More tab
    - Add the fields to the URL Keys block,
      separated by newlines.
