## Use-cases

Some common use-cases that we often see:

1. I want to prefill data like email addresses into my embeddable that users have already entered previously on my site.
2. I want to prefill data from my embeddable into an embedded component inside it, like a Calendly booker or Stripe component.
3. I want to pass data like email addresses out of my embeddable to be used on a subsequent page on my website.

<Info>
This doc is for passing data to be immediately prefilled somewhere in front of the user.

For ways of sending/receiving the data to/from an external source like an API, database or SaaS app, check out [How To: Decide how to send/receive data](/how-to/decide-how-to-send-data)

## Passing data into an embeddable to prefill fields (e.g. email address)

### Method 1: URL params

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the fields into the URL as params">
    - For example: `https://mywebsite.com/onboarding?email=ada@lovelace.com`.
    - Make sure that this is the URL when the embeddable first loads,
      since that's when it will look for URL params.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set those fields to be URL-controlled">
    - Head to the embeddable-wide settings
    - Go to the More tab
    - Add the fields to the URL Keys block,
      separated by newlines.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Embed code attributes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add each field as an attribute on the <savvy> HTML element">
    - For example: `<savvy id="flow_abc" email="ada@lovelace.com"></savvy>`.
    - Make sure that these attributes are present when the element is first added
      to the DOM, since that's when it will look for URL params.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set those fields to be Embed Code-controlled">
    - Head to the embeddable-wide settings
    - Go to the More tab
    - Add the fields to the Embed Code block,
      separated by newlines.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 3: Custom code using Window variable

<Note>
  This works best when you want to prefill data immediately (as soon as the
  embeddable loads).
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Place the data on a Window variable in your website/webapp">
    - From within your website or webapp, create a variable
      in the Window scope with a unique name.
    - Add the data you want to prefill into that variable.
    - **Make sure to that this happens before the embeddable loads.**

    ```javascript Your Website/Webapp Code
    window.myEmbeddablesPrefillData = {
      email: 'ada@lovelace.com'
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a custom code Action, triggered on first load">
    For more info on how to do this, check out:
    <Card
      title="How To: Run custom code when the Embeddable loads"
      href="/how-to/run-custom-code-on-load"
    ></Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grab the data from the Window variable, and then set the User Data">
    - Pull out the data from the Window variable that you 
      set up in Step 1.
    - Then use `helperFunctions.setUserData()` to set the
      User Data based on the payload sent with that event:

    ```javascript Custom Code Action - Triggered on First Load
    function output(userData, helperFunctions) {
      const dataToPrefill = window.myEmbeddablesPrefillData
        if (dataToPrefill) {
          helperFunctions.setUserData(dataToPrefill);
        }
      });
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  
</Steps>

### Method 4: Custom code using custom Window event

<Note>
  This works best when you want to prefill data after the embeddable has already
  loaded
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a custom code Action, triggered on first load">
    For more info on how to do this, check out:
    <Card
      title="How To: Run custom code when the Embeddable loads"
      href="/how-to/run-custom-code-on-load"
    ></Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Listen for a custom Window event, and then set the User Data">
    - Use `window.addEventListener()` to listen for a
      custom event that you will define.
    - Then use `helperFunctions.setUserData()` to set the
      User Data based on the payload sent with that event:

    ```javascript Custom Code Action - Triggered on First Load
    function output(userData, helperFunctions) {
      window.addEventListener('embeddables:my_custom_prefill_event', (event) => {
        const detail = event.detail || {};
        const dataToPrefill = detail.prefill_data
        if (dataToPrefill) {
          helperFunctions.setUserData(dataToPrefill);
        }
      });
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the custom Window event from your website/webapp">
    - From your website or webapp, create a new
      Custom Event with the prefill data, and
      send it to the Window:

    ```javascript Your Website/Webapp Code
    const myEvent = new CustomEvent('embeddables:my_custom_prefill_event', {
      detail: {
        prefill_data: {
          email: 'ada@lovelace.com'
        }
      }
    })
    window.dispatchEvent(myEvent);
    ```
