You can use the 2-part embed code to easily embed your embeddable in your website or web app.

Please refer to our more specific pages for [embedding in a React app](publish-in-react) or a [React Native app](publish-in-react-native).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab the embed code" titleSize="h3">
    Head to the embeddable in the [Web App](https://app.embeddables.com/) and
    view the embed code from the button at the top.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/embed-button.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert the first part in the Head">
    The first part of the embed code (the large part) should go in the `<HEAD>` of the page.

    <Note>
    **This only needs to be added once**.
    If it's already installed on all pages of your site then you can skip this step.
    </Note>

    This is the large part that starts like this:

    ```html Embed Code - Part 1/2
    <script> const SAVVY_PRELOAD_IDS=...
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert the second part in the Body">
    The second part of the embed code should go in the `<BODY>` of the page, wherever you want the embeddable to appear on the page.

    The is the part that looks like this (where `flow_abcdefhijklm` is your embeddable ID):

    ```html Embed Code - Part 2/2
    <savvy id="flow_abcdefhijklm"></savvy>
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>
