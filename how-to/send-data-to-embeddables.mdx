Although most user events occur when the user interacts with your Embeddable, meaning Embeddables will automatically capture that event, there are times when user events occur elsewhere.

In those cases, you can send data to the Embeddables API using a server-side request.

## How to send data to Embeddables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate an Embeddables API key">
    - Contact the Embeddables team to generate an API key for your project.
    - API keys are Restricted Keys, and always start with `rk_` - for example: `rk_myexampleapikey`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare your event data">
    - Create a JSON object with the following required fields:
      - `embeddable_id`: The ID of your Embeddable
      - `timestamp`: The time the event occurred (in ISO 8601 format)
      - `custom_event_name`: A name for your custom event (must be snake_case)
      - `custom_event_props`: Any custom properties as a JSON string
      - `identifiers`: A list of key-value pairs to identify the user (e.g., email)

    <Tip>
      The `identifiers` field is an array of objects, each containing a `key` and `value`. Currently, we only support one identifier per request (i.e. one object in the array).
    </Tip>
    <Warning>
      **Watch out for this:** The `value` field must be a stringified JSON value. E.g. for email addresses, the value must be `"\"test@test.com\""` (note the double quotes).
    </Warning>
  </Step>


  <Step title="Send the event to the API">
    - Make a POST request to `/projects/{projectId}/events`
    - Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header
    - Send the event data in the request body

    Example request:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.embeddables.com/projects/pr_myexampleproject/events \
      -H "X-Api-Key: rk_myexampleapikey" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "embeddable_id": "flow_myexampleflow",
        "timestamp": "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
        "custom_event_name": "my_custom_event",
        "custom_event_props": "{\"my_prop\": \"my_val\"}",
        "identifiers": [
          {
            "key": "email",
            "value": "\"test@test.com\""
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The API will return a 200 status code if the event was successfully created. If there are any issues with the request (e.g., invalid API key, missing required fields), you'll receive an appropriate error response.
</Note>
