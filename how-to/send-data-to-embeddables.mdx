Although most user events occur when the user interacts with your Embeddable, meaning Embeddables will automatically capture that event, there are times when user events occur elsewhere.

For example, a user completing a doctor's appointment, or a user completing a purchase that isn't handled by Embeddables' Stripe integration.

In those cases, you can [send data to the Embeddables API using a server-side request](/api-reference/events/create-event).

## How to send data to Embeddables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate an Embeddables API key">
    - Contact the Embeddables team to generate an API key for your project.
    - API keys are Restricted Keys, and always start with `rk_` - for example: `rk_myexampleapikey`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare your event data">
    - Create a JSON object with the following required fields:
      - `embeddable_id`: The ID of your Embeddable
      - `timestamp`: The time the event occurred (in ISO 8601 format)
      - `custom_event_name`: A name for your custom event (must be snake_case)
      - `custom_event_props`: Any custom properties as a JSON string
      - `identifiers`: A list of key-value pairs to identify the user (e.g., email)

    <Tip>
      The `identifiers` field is an array of objects, each containing a `key` and `value`. Currently, we only support one identifier per request (i.e. one object in the array).
    </Tip>
    <Warning>
      **Watch out for this:** The `value` field must be a stringified JSON value. E.g. for email addresses, the value must be `"\"test@test.com\""` (note the double quotes).
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the event to the API">
    - Make a POST request to `/projects/{projectId}/events`
    - Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header
    - Send the event data in the request body

    Example request:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.embeddables.com/projects/pr_myexampleproject/events \
      -H "X-Api-Key: rk_myexampleapikey" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "embeddable_id": "flow_myexampleflow",
        "timestamp": "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
        "custom_event_name": "my_custom_event",
        "custom_event_props": "{\"my_prop\": \"my_val\"}",
        "identifiers": [
          {
            "key": "email",
            "value": "\"test@test.com\""
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The API will return a 200 status code if the event was successfully created.
  If there are any issues with the request (e.g., invalid API key, missing
  required fields), you'll receive an appropriate error response.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting a 404 `ENTRY_NOT_FOUND` response

This means that the Embeddables API is trying to find a user that matches the `identifiers` you provided, for the `embeddable_id` you provided, but couldn't find one.

Things to look out for:

1. Check that you are passing the correct `embeddable_id` - this should be the ID of the Embeddable that matches the user you're trying to add an event for.
2. Check that you are passing the correct `key` inside `identifiers` - this should be the key in the User Data that matches the input component that the user typed in, such as `email` or `user_email`.
3. Check that you are passing the correct `value` inside `identifiers` - make sure that this matches the user that you're trying to track, and matches the key and embeddable ID that you're using.
4. Check that you are formatting `identifiers` correctly - the value must be a stringified JSON value. E.g. for email addresses, the value must be `"\"test@test.com\""` (note the double quotes). This can become double-escaped (e.g. `"\\"test@test.com\\""`) in certain code environments.
5. Check that the user has definitely provided their unique identifier before the track event is triggered - trying to track a user based on an email address that hasn't been captured yet is impossible.
