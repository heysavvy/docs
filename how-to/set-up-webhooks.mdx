## What the Webhooks feature is for

Sometimes instead of using one of our built-in integrations, you will need to send [User Data](#user-data) out to an external application that we don't yet support, or perhaps a custom application of your own (e.g. your own API or database).

Webhooks are perfect for that scenario, and Embeddables has a dedicated Webhooks feature that you can use.

<Info>
  **What are Webhooks?** Webhooks are a technology that are similar to APIs
  except they work in the reverse direction!
  
  So while the provider of an API ***listens*** for requests from other applications (and responds accordingly),
  the provider of a webhook ***sends*** events to any applications that tell it
  they're listening for events.

In other words, with APIs each event is triggered by the external application,
whereas with webhooks each event is triggered by the webhook provider themselves.

## How to use Webhooks in Embeddables

Webhooks in Embeddables are powered by [Svix](https://svix.com/), an excellent service that integrates nicely into our systems and handles all the detailed features that we would ever want to build.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Webhook in the Embeddables Builder">
    - In the Builder, go to the Logic sidebar and click on the Actions tab.
    - Click `+ Add New Action`.
    - Give it a name, and select `Webhook` as the Action type.
    - Hit `Add`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger the Webhook from an event">
    - Go to the Triggers tab.
    - Add a new Trigger.
    - Choose the event that you want to trigger the Action on.
    - Select the Webhook Action you just created.
    - Hit `Add`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your destination URL to the list of endpoints in Embeddables">
    - In the [Embeddables Web App](https://app.embeddables.com), go to Settings > Integrations.
    - In the Webhooks card, click `Manage Webhooks`.
    - Your Svix portal will open in a new tab.
    - On the Endpoints page, click `+ Add Endpoint`.
    - Add your URL into the `Endpoint URL` field.
    - Leave the `Subscribe to events` field blank to receive all events.
    - Hit `Add`.
    <Note>
      Currently, you can add multiple destination URLs, but they will all receive all events. The ability to subscribe to specific events is coming soon.
