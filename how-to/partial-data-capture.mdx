**Partial data capture** is easy to achieve in Embeddables.

In fact, it is typically enabled by default, because Embeddables collects users' answers as they provide them, and (depending on the field's settings) stores them for use in analytics later on.

There are also ways to implement custom partial data capture where you send user answers to your own backend, e.g. your API or a CRM.

## Storing partial user data in Embeddables

As described in the [User Data](/features/user-data) guide, each user answer can be stored on three different levels:

1. Only in the context of the current page load (i.e. data is lost when the user refreshes or closes the tab).
2. #1 and also in Local Storage in the user's browser (i.e. the session is resumed when the user reloads the page again later).
3. #1, #2 and also in Embeddables' database (i.e. the data is also available for use in analytics in the Embeddables Web App).

Therefore, any fields that are configured with option #3 will automatically be captured as partial data, as the user enters the information, and will be visible later in the Embeddables Web App (to logged-in users with sufficient permissions).

## Sending partial user data to your own backend

To send partial user data to your own backend, you can:
1. Add an Action with custom code that sends the data to your backend,
2. Add a Trigger to execute that Action when the user reaches a key page or clicks an important button.

### Instructions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom code Action">
    - Go to the Logic sidebar and click on the Actions tab
    - Click `+ Add New Action`
    - Give it a descriptive name like "Send Data to Backend"
    - Hit `Add`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write your custom code">
    - Add code similar to the example below, which sends user data to your backend API:

```js
// All Actions must contain a function called output()
function output(userData) {
  // Construct the data object with the user's answers
  const dataToSend = {
    ...userData,
  };

  // Replace with your backend API endpoint
  const url = "https://your-api.example.com/data";
  
  // Optional: Add any required headers
  const headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  };

  // Send POST request
  fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(dataToSend),
  });
}
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Triggers for user events">
    - Switch to the Triggers tab
    - Add a new Trigger
    - Choose the event that should trigger sending data. For example:
      - `WHEN Page IS Changed` to send data on every page change
      - `WHEN Button KEY submit_button IS Clicked` to send on button click
    - Select your "Send Data to Backend" Action
    - Hit `Add`
    - Repeat for any other events you want to trigger the Action, e.g. all key milestone pages in your funnel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the integration">
    - Preview your Embeddable
    - Open your browser's developer tools to monitor network requests
    - Verify that data is being sent to your backend when the triggers fire
    - Check that the data structure matches what your backend expects
