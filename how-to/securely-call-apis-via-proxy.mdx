description: "Learn how to securely call external APIs using the Embeddables Proxy by configuring credentials and endpoints in your project settings."

The Embeddables Secure Proxy is great for solving one or both of the following when calling APIs from the frontend in an Embeddable:

- You want to call an API that requires a credential, but you don't want to that credential to be exposed on the frontend.
- You're having issues with CORS when calling an API from the frontend.


## How the Secure Proxy Works

The new proxy comes with the following features:

- **Allowlisting of endpoints and credentials**: Only allowlisted endpoints and credentials can be used for the specific environment + project combination. Disallowlisted endpoints or credentials will be blocked.
- **Request results are returned as-is**: The proxy does not tamper with the received requests in any way. What you see is what you get.
- **`X-Proxy-Worker-Success` header**: This header will be `true` if the proxy made your request, and `false` if it wasn't able to for some reason. If you receive a 400 response and are unsure if it's coming from the proxy or the final destination, check this header.

## Adding Credentials and Endpoints in Project Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Project Settings">
    Navigate to your project's settings and select the <strong>Credentials & Endpoints</strong> tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Credentials">
    Click the <strong>+ New Credential</strong> button and fill in the required fields:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Type</strong>: Select the type of service (e.g., EHR, CRM, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Service Name</strong>: The name of the service (e.g., Tellescope, CareGLP, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Key Type</strong>: The type of key (e.g., API Key, Token, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Environment</strong>: Choose the environment (Production, Staging, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Label</strong>: A descriptive label for your credential</li>
      <li><strong>Value</strong>: The actual credential value (the secret that you're protecting)</li>
    </ul>
    Your credentials will appear in the list, each with a unique identifier and label.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Endpoints">
    Click the <strong>+ New Endpoint</strong> button and fill in the required fields:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Label</strong>: A descriptive label for the endpoint</li>
      <li><strong>Environment</strong>: Select the environment</li>
      <li><strong>Allowed Origins (Regex)</strong>: Regex for allowlisted origins (e.g., your frontend domains)</li>
      <li><strong>Allowed Destinations (Regex)</strong>: Regex for allowlisted API destinations</li>
      <li><strong>Credential IDs</strong>: Select the credentials that can be used with this endpoint</li>
    </ul>
    Your endpoints will appear in the list, showing the allowlisted origins, destinations, and associated credentials.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Credentials in Your API Requests

Once your credentials and endpoints are set up, you can use them in your API calls through the proxy. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use a credential in your request headers:

```js
const weightLossProductsOptions = {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "My-Secret-Header": '{{cred_aaaaaaaaaaaaaa}}', // Use the credential reference here
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      'X-Environment': 'production',
      'X-Project-ID': "pr_bbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(weightLossProductsBody),
  };

fetch(
  `https://proxy-worker.heysavvy.workers.dev/?url=${encodeURIComponent(
    'https://api.example.com/api/v1/endpoint'
  )}`,
  weightLossProductsOptions
)
  .then((response) => {
    // handle response
  })
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

- Replace the following placeholders with your actual values:
  - `My-Secret-Header` --> the header name that you want to use to pass the credential value.
  - `{{cred_aaaaaaaaaaaaaa}}` --> the credential ID that you created previously. You might alternatively want to use a credential in the URL or body instead of a header. Either way, the proxy will inject the actual credential value for you. 
  - `production` --> the environment you want to call the endpoint in.
  - `pr_bbbbbbbbbbbbbb` --> the project ID for your project (grab it from the URL in the Embeddables Web App - it's the ID after `/project/`).
  - `https://api.example.com/api/v1/endpoint` --> the actual endpoint you want to call.
- Make sure the endpoint and credential are both allowlisted with the project and environment that you're using.
