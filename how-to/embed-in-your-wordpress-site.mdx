You can use the 2-part embed code to easily embed your embeddable in your WordPress website. The method you use will depend on whether you're using WordPress.com or WordPress.org, and your technical comfort level.

## WordPress.com vs WordPress.org

Before we begin, it's important to understand the difference:

- **WordPress.com**: A hosted platform with different plan levels (Free, Personal, Premium, Business, Commerce)
- **WordPress.org**: Self-hosted WordPress where you have full control over your site

## Embedding in WordPress.com

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your plan level" titleSize="h3">
    The ability to add custom code depends on your WordPress.com plan:
    - **Free, Personal, and Premium plans**: Limited code support
    - **Business and Commerce plans**: Full code support

    If you're on a limited plan, you'll need to upgrade to add custom code.

  <Step title="Grab the embed code" titleSize="h3">
    Head to the Embeddable in the [Web App](https://app.embeddables.com/), click **Embed Code** in the top-right corner,
    and you'll see the two-part embed code in the pop-up modal.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the code to your site" titleSize="h3">
    For WordPress.com sites, you have two options:

    ### Option 1: Using the Custom HTML Block (Easiest)
    1. Edit the page where you want to add the embeddable
    2. Add a Custom HTML block
    3. Paste both parts of the embed code into the block
    4. Save and publish your changes

    ### Option 2: Using the Customizer (More Control)
    1. Go to Appearance → Customize
    2. Click on Additional CSS
    3. Add the first part of the code (the script) in the CSS section
    4. Save and publish
    5. Add the second part (the `<savvy>` tag) where you want the embeddable to appear using a Custom HTML block
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Embedding in WordPress.org

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab the embed code" titleSize="h3">
    Head to the Embeddable in the [Web App](https://app.embeddables.com/), click **Embed Code** in the top-right corner,
    and you'll see the two-part embed code in the pop-up modal.

  <Step title="Choose your embedding method" titleSize="h3">
    For WordPress.org sites, you have several options based on your technical comfort level:

    ### Option 1: Using a Plugin (Easiest)
    1. Install and activate the "Insert Headers and Footers" plugin
    2. Go to Settings → Insert Headers and Footers
    3. Paste the first part of the code (the script) in the "Scripts in Header" section
    4. Save changes
    5. Add the second part (the `<savvy>` tag) where you want the embeddable to appear using a Custom HTML block

    ### Option 2: Using Theme Files (Intermediate)
    1. Install and activate a child theme
    2. Edit your child theme's `functions.php` file
    3. Add the first part of the code using the `wp_head` hook
    4. Add the second part (the `<savvy>` tag) where you want the embeddable to appear using a Custom HTML block

    ### Option 3: Direct File Editing (Advanced)
    1. Access your site files via FTP or your hosting control panel
    2. Edit your theme's `header.php` file
    3. Add the first part of the code just before the closing `</head>` tag
    4. Add the second part (the `<savvy>` tag) where you want the embeddable to appear using a Custom HTML block
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### The embeddable isn't showing up on my WordPress site

Make sure you've:
1. Added the first part of the code correctly (in the header or using a plugin)
2. Published your changes
3. Checked that the Embeddable is pushed live in the Embeddables Builder (if not then you can add `?savvy_flow_version=latest` to the URL to view the latest version)
4. Cleared your browser cache and refreshed the page
