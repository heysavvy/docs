If you need to find where a specific User Data key is being created or updated in your Embeddable, you can search through the entire Embeddable JSON.

## How to search

1. **Open the Builder** for your Embeddable
2. **Press ESC** to deselect any components (so nothing is selected)
3. **In the Options sidebar**, click the **three dots menu** (⋮) in the top right corner
4. **Click "Edit JSON"** to open the JSON editor modal
5. **Use the search inside the code editor box** (Ctrl+F with the code editor in focus) to search for the key name within the JSON

This will show you all locations where that key appears in your Embeddable configuration, including:
- Input fields and form components that create the key
- Actions that update the key
- Computed Fields that are set with their key as the key you're looking for, or that reference the key
- Conditions that use the key

<Tip>
  We're working on shipping a better global search feature that will make this process easier. For now, searching the Entire Embeddable JSON is the most reliable way to find where keys are being used.
