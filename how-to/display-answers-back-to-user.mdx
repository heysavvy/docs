You can use Embeddables' **Templating** feature, a simple templating syntax available in the Builder, to display [User Data](/features/user-data) values within text components or components with text elements.

This allows you to create dynamic, personalized content that updates based on user input or computed values.

## Basic Templating Syntax

To display a User Data value in text, wrap the key name in double curly braces:

```text
{{key_name}}
```

You can do this inside `Plain Text` and `Rich Text` components, as well as inside text fields of other components, such as Labels in `Button` components.

  The value displayed will automatically update whenever the referenced User Data value changes.

## Common Examples

Here are some common ways to use templating:

### Display user input
If you've collected a user's name through an input component with the key `first_name`, you can display it like this:
```text
Thanks for that info, {{first_name}}!
```

### Display computed values
If you have a [Computed Field](/features/computed-fields) that calculates a value (like BMI), you can display the result:
```text
Your BMI is {{bmi}}
```

### Display nested properties
For User Data that contains nested objects (like API responses), you can access nested properties using dot notation:
```text
Error: {{api_response.error_message}}
```

## Tips for using templating

- Make sure the key exists in User Data before trying to display it
- For numbers that need formatting, consider using a [Computed Field](/features/computed-fields) to format the value first
- If the value might be undefined, you can provide a default value using a Computed Field
- Keys are case-sensitive and must match exactly what's in the User Data

## Computed Field + Templating Example: Full name display

Here's a complete example that shows how to display a user's full name using both direct input values and a Computed Field:

1. Collect the first and last name in separate input components with keys `first_name` and `last_name`
2. Create a Computed Field called `full_name` that combines them:
```js
function result(userData) {
  return `${userData.first_name} ${userData.last_name}`;
}
```
3. Display the full name using templating:
```text
Welcome back, {{full_name}}!
```
