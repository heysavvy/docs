description: "Using the Embeddables CMS to define multiple Stripe prices, and pull them into your Embeddable"
---

If you handle multiple Stripe products or prices in your Embeddable, the **Embeddables CMS** is a great way to store them and keep them updated.

Using the Embeddables CMS for this has the following benefits:

- It lets you clearly view your list of Stripe products and prices without needing to read JS code.
- It means non-technical users can update prices without needing to read or edit any code.
- It makes it possible to update prices without needing to push live a new version of your Embeddable.
- It gives you a clear audit trail if prices are changed.

## How to add Stripe prices to the Embeddables CMS, and use them to control prices in your Embeddable

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a table called Prices in the Embeddables CMS">
    - Head to the [Embeddables Web App](https://app.embeddables.com) and select **CMS** in the sidebar.
    - Click **Edit Tables** to start editing.
    - Click **+ Add Table**, select the **Prices** template, and confirm by clicking the **+ Add Table** button.
    - Edit your new table's columns so that you've included the following:

    | Column Name                                      | Column Key        | What it's for                                                                                                                                             |
    |--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Plan Name**                                    | `plan_name`       | Helps you identify what the price corresponds to.                                                                                                         |
    | **Stripe Price ID**                              | `stripe_price_id` | Stores the price ID from Stripe.                                                                                                                          |
    | **Price** (optional)                             | `price_amount`    | Helps you remember what the amount is set to for this price in Stripe.                                                                                    |
    | One or more price attributes e.g. **Price Plan** | `price_plan`      | Set one or more of these columns to distinguish your plans, and be used later in the logic of your Embeddable to determine which price to use for a user. |
      
      
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the prices to your new table">
    - Copy the price information across from Stripe into the new table.
    - You can add as many prices as you like, but in order for the Embeddable's logic to choose the correct price, you'll need to make sure that each price has a unique combination of price attributes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pull the prices into your Embeddable">
    - Copy the table ID of the table you just created.
    - Head to the Embeddables Builder.
    - Make sure you don't have any components or pages selected, then go to Options and click **Edit JSON**.
    - Add the following JSON to your Embeddable JSON (remove the comments since JSON doesn't support comments):
    ```json
    {
      // ...Your Embeddable JSON...,
      "content_sources": [
        {
          "source_type": "embeddables_cms",
          "source_config": {
            "table_id": "<YOUR TABLE ID>"
          },
          "multiple_records": true,
          "key": "stripe_prices"
        }
      ],
      // ...Embeddable JSON continues...,
    }
    ```

    What this does:
    - Adds a new **Content Source** to your Embeddable, which is how you pull in external data.
    - Tells the Embeddable that the type of source is the **Embeddables CMS**, and provide the ID of the table you want to pull data from.
    - Tells the Embeddable that you want to allow **multiple records** to be returned (as opposed to pulling a single record based on the URL of the page, which is a different use-case of the Embeddables CMS).
    - Tells the Embeddables to store the table's content under the key `stripe_prices` in the **User Data** (it will be stored as an array of objects, where each object represents a row from the table).


    <Tip>
      A UI for connecting an Embeddable to a table in the Embeddables CMS, so that you don't need to modify the JSON, is coming soon!
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up a Computed Field to choose the correct price">
    - Add `stripe_prices` to the list of **Registered Keys** in the Embeddable Options, so that you can access it in Computed Fields.
    - Create a new Computed Field called `stripe_line_items` - this will calculate the exact line items to pass to the Stripe Checkout.
    - Add `stripe_prices` to the inputs of the Computed Field, along with any other User Data keys you'll need in order to choose the correct price (e.g. a `chosen_price_plan` key from an Option Selector).
    - Add the following code to the Computed Field, modifying it where necessary to match your pricing plan structure and the options you give to your users:

    ```js
    function result({ stripe_prices, chosen_price_plan }) {
      const TEST_PRICE_ID = "price_1JMwNRIQ3JVMlttKsvCn3lK3"; // Test Recurring Price ID for use when in test mode

      // Find the correct price from the CMS
      const stripePrice = stripe_prices?.find(price => price.price_plan === chosen_price_plan)

      // Return the live items
      // If in test mode, use the test price ID; otherwise use the live price ID
      return [
        {
          price: isTestMode() ? testPriceId : stripePrice?.stripe_price_id,
          quantity: 1,
        },
      ];
    }

    // This function mimics the logic of the Embeddable when it uses the URL to decide whether to be in test mode or not
    function isTestMode() {
      const url = new URL(window.location);
      const params = url.searchParams
      return params.get("savvy_test") === "true" ||
        (!params.get("savvy_test") && params.get("savvy_env")) ||
        (!params.get("savvy_test") && url.host.endsWith("embeddables.com"));
    }

    ```

    <Note>
      It's important to use a test price ID when in test mode, because Stripe's test mode insists on using test price IDs, not live ones.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finally, update the Stripe Checkout to use the output of the Computed Field">
    - Go to your checkout page and select your Stripe Checkout component (if you haven't already set this up, you can read how to do that [here](/features/stripe-payments)).
    - In the Line Items section of the Stripe component, enable "Use template line items".
    - In the "Line items template" field, enter the key of the Computed Field you created: `{{stripe_line_items}}`.
    
    This tells the Stripe component to use the output of your Computed Field as the value of `line_items`, which gets sent to Stripe.
