  <Step title="Install the Embeddables script on the site or page" titleSize="h3">
    <Note>
      **This only needs to be added once** per site or page, depending on your chosen installation method.
      If it's already installed, you can skip this step.

    4. Paste the first part of the embed code (the long script) in the "End of head tag" input
    5. Click Save

    ### Option 2: Page-specific Installation
    To install Embeddables on a specific page:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Embeddable to your page" titleSize="h3">
    To add the specific Embeddable where you want it to appear:
    1. Click the gear icon in the top-right corner to open Project Settings
    2. Select the page where you want the Embeddable to appear
    3. Go to the "Start of body tag" section

## Troubleshooting

### The Embeddable isn't showing up on my Framer site

Make sure you've:
1. Added the first part of the code correctly in the "End of head tag" section
2. Added the second part of the code in the "Start of body tag" section
3. Published your site (the Embeddable won't show up in preview)
4. Checked that the Embeddable is pushed live in the Embeddables Builder (if not then you can add `?savvy_flow_version=latest` to the URL to view the latest version)
5. Cleared your browser cache and refreshed the page
