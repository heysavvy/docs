Embedding your Embeddable in a React Native app involves using the WebView
component that comes as part of the `react-native-webview` library.

We use `WebView` to embed an Embeddables preview URL, since we can't pass HTML
directly into the `WebView`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the react-native-webview library">
    If you don't already have it installed, run:

    ```shell
    npm i react-native-webview
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Import WebView into your React file">
    ```javascript
    import { WebView } from "react-native-webview";
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert a WebView">
    
    ```javascript
    <WebView
      source={{
        uri: "https://engine.embeddables.com/preview/flow_abcdefhijklm",
      }}
    />
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional: Give it dimensions">
    If you can't see it initially, make sure to give it some styles
    to ensure that it has non-zero zero dimensions:
    
    ```javascript
    <WebView
      style={{
        width: 400,
      }}
      source={{
        uri: "https://engine.embeddables.com/preview/flow_abcdefhijklm",
      }}
    />
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional: Pass properties into User Data">
    To pass User Data properties into the Embeddable, include them in the URL as URL params.

    In the Builder, make sure to add those keys into the Embed URL settings of the Embeddable.

    ```javascript
    <WebView
      source={{
        uri: "https://engine.embeddables.com/preview/flow_abcdefhijklm?my_key=my_value",
      }}
    />
    ```

  </Step>
