## Embedding in Webflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab the embed code" titleSize="h3">
    Head to the Embeddable in the [Web App](https://app.embeddables.com/), click **Embed Code** in the top-right corner,
    and you'll see the two-part embed code in the pop-up modal.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the first part to Webflow's Custom Code">
    The first part of the embed code (the large part) should be added to the `<HEAD>` of your Webflow site in the [Custom Code settings](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961357265299-Custom-code-in-head-and-body-tags#head-code).

    This is the large part that starts like this:

    ```html Embed Code - Part 1/2
    <script> const SAVVY_PRELOAD_IDS=...
    ```
    
    <Note>
    **This only needs to be added once**.
    If it's already installed on your Webflow site then you can skip this step.
    </Note>

    <Tip>
      Here are Webflow's [official docs on adding custom code to the `<HEAD>`](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961357265299-Custom-code-in-head-and-body-tags#head-code).
    </Tip>

    To add this in Webflow:
    1. Go to Site Settings
    2. Navigate to the Custom Code tab
    3. Paste the first part of the embed code in the "Head Code" section
    4. Click Save

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the second part using Webflow's Embed element">
    The second part of the embed code should be added using Webflow's Code Embed element where you want the embeddable to appear on the page.

    The is the part that looks like this (where `flow_abcdefhijklm` is your embeddable ID):

    ```html Embed Code - Part 2/2
    <savvy id="flow_abcdefhijklm"></savvy>
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      Here are Webflow's [official docs on the Code Embed element](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961332238611-Custom-code-embed).
    </Tip>

    To add this in Webflow:
    1. Drag a Code Embed element onto your page
    2. Double-click the Embed element
    3. Paste the second part of the embed code
    4. Click Save & Close


  </Step>

## Troubleshooting

### The embeddable isn't showing up on my Webflow site

Make sure you've:
1. Added the first part of the code to the Head Code section in Project Settings
2. Published your site after making these changes
3. Checked that the Embeddable is pushed live in the Embeddables Builder (if not then you can add `?savvy_flow_version=latest` to the URL to view the latest version)
3. Cleared your browser cache and refreshed the page
