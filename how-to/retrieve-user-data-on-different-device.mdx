This guide explains how to implement user session recovery when users access your application from a different device, typically through email or SMS remarketing campaigns.

## Overview

To securely allow users to resume their session on a different device, you'll need to:
1. Generate a **Hashed Token**, which is generated from the user's Entry ID, an expiration timestamp, and a Secret Key.
2. Send users a secure URL that contains this Hashed Token, as well as the user's Entry ID and the expiration timestamp.
3. When a user opens the URL, use the Hashed Token and other parameters to securely call the Embeddables API from the client, which will return the User Data.
4. Use this retrieved User Data to restore the user's session.


## Generating the Hashed Tokens and secure URLs

To generate a Hashed Token and secure URL, you'll need a **Secret Key** - **contact Embeddables Support to get this Secret Key**.

Here's how to generate the Hashed Token and secure URL:

```javascript
// Required parameters
const secretKey = process.env.EMBEDDABLES_LOAD_ENTRY_SECRET_KEY
const entryId = "entry_aaabbbcccdddeeefff"  // The ID of the user's entry
const expiresAt = "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"  // ISO format timestamp

// Generate the hash
const stringToHash = `${secretKey}---${entryId}---${expiresAt}`
const token = sha256(stringToHash, 'utf8', 'hex')

// Construct the final URL
const url = `https://yourwebsite.com/flow?token=${token}&entry_id=${entryId}&expires_at=${expiresAt}`
```

## Client-Side Implementation

Once the user clicks the generated URL, create a Action, triggered on Embeddable Load, with the following code to fetch and restore their session:

```javascript
// All Actions must contain a function called output()
function output(userData, helperFunctions, triggerContext) {
  // Fetch the User Data from the Embeddables API
  await fetch(
    "https://ierxexdtyashuotcsjyo.supabase.co/functions/v1/load_entry_data",
    {
      body: JSON.stringify({
        flow_id: "flow_aaabbbcccdddeeefff", // Your Embeddable ID
        entry_id: "entry_aaabbbcccdddeeefff", // The user's Entry ID
        token: "<HASHED_TOKEN>", // The Hashed Token
        expires: "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", // The expiration timestamp
      }),
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      },
      method: "POST",
    }
  ).then(async (res) => {
    const data = await res.json();
    console.log('Retrieved User Data: ', data)

    // If the User Data is successfully retrieved,
    // set the user data and navigate to the user's current page
    if (data && data.entry) {
      helperFunctions.setUserData({ ...data.entry });
      helperFunctions.goToPage("flow_id", data.entry.current_page_key)
    }
  })
}
```

## Important Notes

1. The secret key should always be stored as an encrypted backend environment variable and never exposed in client-side code.
2. Each URL should have a reasonable expiration time, e.g. 7 days or 30 days.
3. The Hashed Token is unique per user and expiration date.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues:
1. Verify that the secret key is correctly set in your environment variables
2. Ensure the expiration timestamp is in the correct ISO format
3. Check that all URL parameters (token, entry_id, expires_at) are properly encoded
4. Confirm that the necessary permissions are enabled for your application
