Embedding your embeddable in a React app is straightforward, and looks similar to the process of embedding in a regular website.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab the embed code">
    Head to the embeddable in the [Web App](https://app.embeddables.com/) and
    grab the embed code from the button at the top.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert the first part in the Head">
    The first part of the embed code (the large part) should go in the `<HEAD>` of the page.

    This is the large part that starts like this:

    ```html
    <script> const SAVVY_PRELOAD_IDS=...
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert the second part in the Body">
    The second part of the embed code should go in the `<BODY>` of the page, wherever you want the embeddable to appear on the page.

    The is the part that looks like this (where `flow_abcdefhijklm` is your embeddable ID):

    ```html
    <savvy id="flow_abcdefhijklm"></savvy>
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting:

### React is giving me a warning about an unrecognized `<savvy>` tag

Sometimes in the console, you will see this warning log from React:

```mdx Console
Warning: The tag <savvy> is unrecognized in this browser.
If you meant to render a React component, start its name with an
uppercase letter.
```

This warning can be safely ignored, and should have no impact on your app.

However, if you want to avoid the warning appearing in the console, a workaround is to
insert the savvy just after the initial render using React's `useEffect` hook:

```javascript App.js
useEffect(() => {
  const htmlElement = `<savvy id="flow_abcdefhijklm"></savvy>`;
  const container = document.getElementById("my-container"); // Select the container that the embeddable should appear in
  container.innerHTML = htmlElement; // Use '+=' if you want to append the embeddable to the contents of the container, instead of replacing the contents
});
```
