The **Embeddables CMS** can be used to create and manage multiple landing pages from a single template, making it perfect for Search Engine Marketing (SEM) campaigns. This guide will show you how to set up and use the CMS for programmatic page creation.

## Overview

This approach allows you to:
- Create hundreds of targeted landing pages from a single template
- Manage all page content through a user-friendly CMS interface
- Update content without code changes or deployments
- Target different audiences and keywords effectively
- Maintain consistent design while varying content
- Keep an audit trail of updates to your SEM pages, via the Embeddables CMS's version control system


## Setting Up Your CMS Table

### 1. Create a New Table

1. Navigate to the CMS section in the Embeddables Web App
2. Click "Edit Tables"
3. Click "+ Add Table"
4. Select the "Programmatic Pages" template

### 2. Configure Your Columns

The template comes with recommended columns, but you can customize them based on your needs. Here's a suggested structure:

| Column Name        | Column Key       | Type        | Purpose                                        |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Base Path**      | `base_path`      | Text        | Defines the URL pattern to match with the page |
| **Title**          | `title`          | Text        | Page title to display in the h1                |
| **Subtitle**       | `subtitle`       | Text        | Page subtitle to display in the h2             |
| **Hero Image URL** | `hero_image_url` | Text        | URL of the hero image for the page             |
| **CTA Text**       | `cta_text`       | Text        | Call-to-action button text                     |
| **CTA Link**       | `cta_link`       | Text        | Call-to-action button URL                      |

<Tip>
  You can add additional columns based on your specific needs, such as:
  - Extra columns for more custom content further down the page
  - A `product_keys` column with a comma-separated list of keys for the products to feature on the page - you could set up a Computed Field that uses this to filter from a larger list of products, and use Repeatable Option Buttons to display them in the page's content.
</Tip>

### 3. Add some rows

Add some content by adding at least the first few rows - i.e. the first few pages of content.

After the next few steps, you can use this to test out your new programmatic pages.

## Creating Your Embeddable Template

### 1. Connect to the CMS

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Content Source">
    - Create a new Embeddable
    - In the Embeddables Builder, go to Embeddable Options
    - Scroll to the CMS section
    - Click "+ Add Content Source"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Connection">
    - Enter a User Data key (e.g., `cms`)
    - Select your programmatic pages table
    - Under "Which records should get shown?", choose "Records that match a URL pattern"
    - Set the Controller Key to `base_path`
    - Leave "Multiple Records" unchecked since we want one page per record
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register the Key">
    - Add your User Data key to the list of Registered Keys in Embeddable Options
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Design Your Template

Create a single Embeddable template that will serve as the base for all your SEM pages. Include:

- A dynamic title section that pulls from the CMS
- Content areas that can be populated from the CMS
- Image components that use the CMS image URLs
- CTA buttons with dynamic text and links

In each of the content areas, use `{{cms.title}}`, `{{cms.subtitle}}` etc to display the content from the CMS.

## Previewing and Publishing

<Warning>
  When testing your Embeddable on a preview link, add <code>savvy_test=false</code> to the URL to ensure CMS data loads correctly.
</Warning>

To preview the page, open a preview link and add the part of the URL that matches the `base_path` column after a `?` in the URL. This will match the URL pattern required for the particular page.

For example, if the `base_path` is `seo-services`, the URL will be `https://preview.embeddables.com/flow_aaaaaaa?savvy_test=false&base_path=/product-iphone`.

- Use the `savvy_cms` URL parameter to preview the page with the latest version of the CMS data:
  - `savvy_cms=latest` to preview the latest version
  - `savvy_cms=123` to preview a specific version
  - `savvy_cms=staging` to preview the staging version

## Best Practices

1. **URL Structure**
   - Use SEO-friendly URL slugs
   - Keep URLs short and descriptive
   - Use hyphens to separate words

2. **Content Management**
   - Maintain consistent formatting across pages
   - Use the rich text editor for content formatting
   - Keep meta descriptions between 150-160 characters

3. **Testing**
   - Preview all pages before publishing
   - Test different CMS versions using the version control system
   - Verify all dynamic content loads correctly

## Example Use Cases

1. **Service Pages**
   - Create targeted pages for different services
   - Customize content for specific industries
   - Use location-based variations

2. **Campaign Landing Pages**
   - Create pages for different marketing campaigns
   - A/B test different content variations
   - Target specific audience segments

3. **Product Pages**
   - Create pages for different product categories
   - Customize content for different price points
   - Target specific customer needs

<Tip>
  Use the CMS version control system to create and test different content variations before pushing them live. This is especially useful for A/B testing different approaches to your SEM pages.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

1. **Content Not Loading**
   - Verify the URL slug matches exactly
   - Check that the Content Source is properly configured
   - Ensure you're using `savvy_test=false` in preview URLs

2. **Version Control Issues**
   - Make sure you're using the correct `savvy_cms` parameter
   - Verify that the version exists in the CMS
   - Check that you have permission to access the version
