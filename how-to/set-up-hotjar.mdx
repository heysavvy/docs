description: "Track user behavior across Embeddable pages using Hotjar heatmaps, recordings, and analytics"

[Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) is a popular tool for heatmaps, session recordings, and user behavior analytics. Because Embeddables handle page navigation internally (without full browser page loads), Hotjar needs a small configuration tweak to correctly detect page changes inside your Embeddable.

The solution relies on syncing Embeddable page changes to the URL as fragments (e.g. `#page_key`), and telling Hotjar to watch for those fragment changes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Turn on Sync URL with Pages in Embeddables">
    In the Embeddables editor, open the **Embeddable-Wide Options** sidebar (press Escape to deselect any pages or components, then open the Options panel on the right).

    Enable the **Sync Pages With The URL** setting.

    This updates the browser URL with a `#page_key` fragment whenever the user navigates to a new page inside the Embeddable (e.g. `yoursite.com/get-started#intro_page`).
  </Step>
  <Step title='Enable fragment tracking in Hotjar'>
    In your Hotjar dashboard, go to your site's tracking settings and enable **"Track changes automatically, including fragments"**.

    This tells Hotjar to treat changes to the `#hash` portion of the URL as page navigations, so each Embeddable page is tracked as a separate page view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the integration">
    Open your Embeddable in a browser and navigate through a few pages. In Hotjar, confirm that each page change appears as a distinct page view with the corresponding `#page_key` in the URL.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Once this is set up, Hotjar heatmaps, recordings, and funnels will reflect individual Embeddable pages rather than treating the entire flow as a single page view.
