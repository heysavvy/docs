Many multi-select questions require a `None of the above` button.

This button should behave differently from the other options - it should not only be selected when clicked, but should also deselect all other options.

Fortunately, there's an easy way to add this functionality in Embeddables.

<Warning>
  This feature is not yet implemented in the Builder UI. For now, you will need
  to add `single_select: true` to the button in the component JSON.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Select the component and open the button settings">
        - Select the Option Selector component.
        - Navigate to the Options sidebar.
        - Click the <Icon icon="pencil" iconType="solid" /> Edit icon button next to the "None of the above" button.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set the button to be a 'single select' option">
        - Check the option called "Single select".
        - This makes the button single-select only, meaning that once it's selected, all of the other buttons are deselected.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
