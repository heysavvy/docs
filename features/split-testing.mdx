**Experiments** are deeply intergated into the Embeddables platform.

They make use of two of the core features of Embeddables: [Conditions](/features/conditions) and [User Data](/features/user-data).

<Card title="How Experiments work in Embeddables" icon="flask">
  When an experiment is launched, it randomly assigns a variant to each user by setting it as a value in User Data.

For example, an experiment with the key `split_hero_title_length` that has 2 variants (`control_no_change` and `variant_longer_title`) might set the following in User Data for a user:

```
split_hero_title_length: 'variant_longer_title'
```

Then, to change the experience for that user, you set up Conditions on various pages or components to hide/show them based on the current variant.

For example, you could clone the title, change the length of the new title, and add a condition to each title component so that each one is only shown if its corresponding variant is active.

## How to set up an Experiment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new Experiment">
    - Click on the Logic tab (top-left).
    - Click on the Experiments tab beneath it to open the Experiments sidebar.
    - Click `+ Add new experiment`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the keys and variant percentages">
    - Choose a key for the experiment. Experiment keys always start with `split_`.
    <Tip>A good key is unique to the experiment and describes what is being tested, e.g. `split_hero_title_length`.</Tip>
    - Choose keys for each variant.
    <Tip>We recommend that the control key starts with `control_` (e.g. `control_no_change`) and `variant_` (e.g. `variant_longer_title` or `variant_shorter_title`).</Tip>
    - Choose the percentage of traffic to be directed to each variant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change the content for each variant">
    - Select the page or component that you want to modify based on this Experiment (if multiple pages/components, just repeat the tasks in this step for each one).
    - Clone that page or component, and modify it to match what you want users in your first variant to see (e.g. change the title text to be longer).
    - Go to the Options sidebar (the tab on the right-hand-side) and add an Experiment Condition to the page/component, matching the experiment key and the variant key that matches this content.
    <Tip>This will likely make the current page/component disappear, since you are not currently viewing that variant.</Tip>
    - Add a similar Experiment Condition onto the control version of your component/page.
    <Tip>A `no_value` value will be added to the Experiment Condition on the control variant, so that it will always be shown by default.</Tip>
    - Repeat for any other variants by cloning the page/component, changing the content, and updating the Experiment Condition.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview, test and push live for real users">
    - You can now preview your changes by re-opening the Experiments sidebar, selecting the Experiment, and clicking the Preview (<Icon icon="eye" iconType="solid" />) icon buttons next to each variant in the sidebar on the right-hand side.
    - Once you're happy, save your changes.
    - You can now test it out by using the [`savvy_flow_version=latest` URL params](/features/testing-and-debugging/url-params).
    - If you want to force a particular variant, you can add the key and value as a URL param. (Don't forget that once you're assigned a variant, you will be kept in that variant unless you clear local storage or switch browsers).
    - To launch this experiment for real users, just push the version to Staging and then to Production.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Pausing an Experiment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Pause on the Experiment">
    - You can pause an Experiment by selecting the Experiment, and in the
    right-hand sidebar press <Icon icon="pause" iconType="solid" />
    `Pause`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a default variant">
    - Select which variant to display to users while the Experiment is
    paused.
  </Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>
  Pausing an Experiment moves the `no_value` value to the Experiment Conditions
  in the pages/components associated with that variant.
  
  This means that the Experiment and variant keys can be no longer added into the User Data, and the chosen variant will become the default for all new users.

Existing users with previously assigned variants will be unaffected and will keep those variants.

</Tip>

## Ending an Experiment

<Warning>
  Ending an Experiment is final and can't be reversed. The only way to undo this
  is to switch to a previous version where the Experiment was still active and
  save from that version.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select End on the Experiment">
    - To end an Experiment, select the Experiment, and in the
    right-hand sidebar press <Icon icon="stop" iconType="solid" />
    `End`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose the winning variant">
    - Select which variant to display to users moving forward.
    - This will delete all pages/components associated with the other variants, and remove all Experiment Conditions relating to this Experiment.
  </Step>

</Steps>
