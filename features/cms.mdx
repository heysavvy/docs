The **Embeddables CMS** is a powerful content management system that lets you control dynamic content in your Embeddables from outside the Builder.

It provides a user-friendly interface for managing data like **Stripe prices** or **programmatic SEM page content**, that can be used across all your Embeddables.

## Key Benefits

- **No-Code Updates**: Make content changes without modifying or deploying code.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple table-based interface for managing data.
- **Audit Trail**: Track changes to your content over time.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes in the CMS are immediately reflected in your Embeddables.
- **Non-Technical Users**: Enable team members to update content without coding knowledge.

## How to Use the CMS

### Creating Tables

1. Navigate to the CMS section in the Embeddables Web App.
2. Click "Edit Tables" to begin.
3. Select "+ Add Table" and choose from available templates or start with a blank table.
4. Configure your columns with appropriate names, keys, and types.

### Managing Content

- Add rows to your tables with the "+ Add Row" button.
- Edit existing content by clicking on cells.
- Each table has a unique ID that you'll use to connect it to your Embeddables.

### Connecting to Embeddables

To use CMS data in your Embeddable:

1. Copy your table's ID.
2. In the Embeddables Builder, go to the Embeddable Options.
3. Open the Embeddable JSON editor and add a `content_sources` array with the following properties:

```json
{
  "content_sources": [
    {
      "source_type": "embeddables_cms",
      "source_config": {
        "table_id": "<YOUR_TABLE_ID>" // @TODO: Replace with your table's ID
      },
      "key": "your_data_key", // The key to store the data in the User Data
      "controller_type"?: "url_pattern", // Optional: If you want to control the data shown based on the URL, set this to "url_pattern"
      "controller_key"?: "webpage_key", // Optional: The column in your table that contains the regex pattern to match against the current URL
      "multiple_records": boolean, // Optional: Whether to return all records that match the controller pattern (if no controller pattern then just return all records), or a single record
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Add your chosen User Data key to the list of Registered Keys in the Embeddable Options.
5. You can now reference the data in your Embeddable, just like you would with any other User Data property.

### Utilizing CMS Version Control

Just like the Embeddables Builder, the Embeddables CMS comes with a built-in version control system that allows you to track changes to your content over time.

You can save a new version, switch versions, and push a version to staging or production, from the controls in the top right of the CMS page (when Editing Tables).

To preview an Embeddable with the content from a specific CMS version, you can use the `savvy_cms` URL parameter, which works in the same way as the `version` parameter:

- To preview a particular version, add `savvy_cms=123` to the URL.
- To preview the latest version (useful if you're making lots of updates), just use `savvy_cms=latest`.
- To preview the version currently on staging, use `savvy_cms=staging`.

<Tip>
  This is a great way to preview what your CMS content updates will look like before pushing them live.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Managing Stripe Prices

The CMS can manage your Stripe pricing configuration, making it easy to update prices without code changes.

**Example Table Structure:**

| Column Name        | Column Key        | Purpose                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Plan Name**      | `plan_name`       | Identifies the pricing plan               |
| **Stripe Price ID**| `stripe_price_id` | Links to Stripe's price ID                |
| **Price Amount**   | `price_amount`    | Displays the actual price                 |
| **Size**           | `size`            | Distinguishes between plan sizes          |
| **Discount Type**  | `discount`        | Identifies if this is a discounted price  |

This setup allows you to:
- Maintain multiple pricing tiers.
- Update prices without writing code or saving new versions.
- Give non-technical team members ability to manage pricing.
- Keep a clear audit trail of price changes.

### 2. Programmatic Pages

Use the CMS to control content displayed on templated pages based on URL parameters.

**Example Table Structure:**

| Column Name         | Column Key       | Purpose                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Page URL**       | `url_slug`        | Defines the URL path for the content      |
| **Title**          | `title`           | Page title to display                     |
| **Description**    | `description`     | Page meta description                     |
| **Content**        | `content`         | Main page content                         |
| **Image URL**      | `image_url`       | Featured image for the page               |

This enables you to:
- Create hundreds of pages from a single template.
- Target different audiences or SEO keywords.
- Update content through the CMS interface.

## Best Practices

1. **Plan Your Schema**: Carefully design your table structure before creating it.
2. **Use Clear Names**: Choose descriptive column names and `snake_case` keys.
4. **Test Updates**: Verify changes on the latest CMS version before pushing to production.

## Available Templates

The CMS comes with several pre-built templates for common use cases:

- **Blank Table**: Start from scratch.
- **Prices**: Manage product/service pricing.
- **URLs & Links**: Handle URL routing and redirects.
- **FAQs**: Organize frequently asked questions.
- **Programmatic Pages**: Control dynamic page content.
- **Coupons**: Manage promotional codes and discounts.

Each template comes with recommended columns and structure, which you can customize to fit your needs.
