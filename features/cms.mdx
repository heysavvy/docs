## How to Use the CMS

### Creating Tables

1. Navigate to the CMS section in the Embeddables Web App.
2. Click "Edit Tables" to begin.
3. Select "+ Add Table" and choose from available templates or start with a blank table.
4. Configure your columns with appropriate names, keys, and types.

### Managing Content

- Add rows to your tables with the "+ Add Row" button.
- Edit existing content by clicking on cells.
- Each table has a unique ID that you'll use to connect it to your Embeddables.

### Connecting to an Embeddable

To use CMS data in your Embeddable:


<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a new Content Source">
    - In the Embeddables Builder, go to the Embeddable Options (make sure to deselect any pages or components by pressing Escape).
    - Scroll down to the CMS section and click `+ Add Content Source`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a User Data key">
    <Title>Enter a key under which to store the data in the User Data.</Title>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a table">
    <Title>Select the table you want to connect to (if you don't see any tables, make sure that you've saved the new table as a version in the CMS).</Title>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure which records are fetched">
    - Under "Which records should get shown?", choose the method by which you want to control which record(s) are included
      - `Show all records` - All records in the table will be fetched (or just the first record if `Multiple Records` is left unchecked)
      - `Records that match a URL pattern` - Only records that match the URL pattern will be fetched (or the first record that matches if `Multiple Records` is left unchecked)
    - If you choose `Records that match a URL pattern`, under "Controller Key", enter a column key that will be used to match the URL pattern.
    - Check the "Multiple Records" checkbox if you want to fetch multiple records - e.g. to display a list of items like FAQs or Prices.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finish setting it up">
    - Add your chosen User Data key to the list of Registered Keys in the Embeddable Options.
    - You can now reference the data in your Embeddable, just like you would with any other User Data property.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  When testing your Embeddable on a preview link, you must add <code>savvy_test=false</code> to the URL to ensure CMS data loads as expected.
</Warning>

### Utilizing CMS Version Control

Just like the Embeddables Builder, the Embeddables CMS comes with a built-in version control system that allows you to track changes to your content over time.

You can save a new version, switch versions, and push a version to staging or production, from the controls in the top right of the CMS page (when Editing Tables).

To preview an Embeddable with the content from a specific CMS version, you can use the `savvy_cms` URL parameter, which works in the same way as the `version` parameter:

- To preview a particular version, add `savvy_cms=123` to the URL.
- To preview the latest version (useful if you're making lots of updates), just use `savvy_cms=latest`.
- To preview the version currently on staging, use `savvy_cms=staging`.

<Tip>
  This is a great way to preview what your CMS content updates will look like before pushing them live.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Managing Stripe Prices

The CMS can manage your Stripe pricing configuration, making it easy to update prices without code changes.

**Example Table Structure:**

| Column Name        | Column Key        | Purpose                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Plan Name**      | `plan_name`       | Identifies the pricing plan               |
| **Stripe Price ID**| `stripe_price_id` | Links to Stripe's price ID                |
| **Price Amount**   | `price_amount`    | Displays the actual price                 |
| **Size**           | `size`            | Distinguishes between plan sizes          |
| **Discount Type**  | `discount`        | Identifies if this is a discounted price  |

This setup allows you to:
- Maintain multiple pricing tiers.
- Update prices without writing code or saving new versions.
- Give non-technical team members ability to manage pricing.
- Keep a clear audit trail of price changes.

### 2. Programmatic SEM Pages

Use the CMS to control content displayed on templated pages based on URL parameters.

This is a great way to create a large number of pages from a single template, so you can utilize **Search Engine Marketing (SEM)** to target different audiences. 

**Example Table Structure:**

| Column Name         | Column Key       | Purpose                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Page URL**       | `url_slug`        | Defines the URL path for the content      |
| **Title**          | `title`           | Page title to display                     |
| **Description**    | `description`     | Page meta description                     |
| **Content**        | `content`         | Main page content                         |
| **Image URL**      | `image_url`       | Featured image for the page               |

This enables you to:
- Create hundreds of pages from a single template.
- Target different audiences or SEO keywords.
- Update content through the CMS interface.

## Best Practices

1. **Plan Your Schema**: Carefully design your table structure before creating it.
2. **Use Clear Names**: Choose descriptive column names and `snake_case` keys.
4. **Test Updates**: Verify changes on the latest CMS version before pushing to production.

## Available Templates

The CMS comes with several pre-built templates for common use cases:

- **Blank Table**: Start from scratch.
- **Prices**: Manage product/service pricing.
- **URLs & Links**: Handle URL routing and redirects.
- **FAQs**: Organize frequently asked questions.
- **Programmatic Pages**: Control dynamic page content.
- **Coupons**: Manage promotional codes and discounts.

Each template comes with recommended columns and structure, which you can customize to fit your needs.
