<Note>
  The DataStream feature is a BETA feature, meaning that we're still ironing out
  the kinks, and you may need to request access to use it right now.

## What DataStream is for

Sometimes you will want to send user data to an external service like Airtable, and then keep sending the updated user data as the user fills out more information.

For example, when a user enters their email, you might want to send that to Airtable straight away - but then when teh user later enters their name you'd like to store that too.

Normally this would result in several rows per user in the Airtable.

Embeddables' DataStream feature is a new feature in Beta that supports updating the existing records in an external source like Airtable, so that each record alwasy has the most up-to-date version of the data.

<Info>
  The Embeddables Data Pipeline processes the queue once every minute, so the
  data you receive can be up to a minute out-of-date.
