There are three ways to embed an Embeddable in your site:

1. Embedding in your site's frontend using the embed code
2. Setting up a reverse proxy
3. Integrating with your site's backend using the Embeddables API


## Embedding in your site's frontend

You can use the 2-part embed code to easily embed your embeddable in your website or web app.

For a more detailed guide, or to see examples of how to embed in a React app or React Native app, check out the following docs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab the embed code" titleSize="h3">
    Head to the specific embeddable in the [Web App](https://app.embeddables.com/) and
    view the embed code from the button at the top.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert the first part in the Head">
    The first part of the embed code (the large part starting with `<script> const SAVVY_PRELOAD_IDS=...`) should go in the `<HEAD>` of the page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert the second part in the Body">
    The second part of the embed code (the small part that looks like `<savvy id="flow_abcdefhijklm"></savvy>`) should go in the `<BODY>` of the page, wherever you want the embeddable to appear on the page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting up a reverse proxy


{/* Point your reverse proxy to https://proxy.embeddables.com.
Verify that by going to yourdomain.com/your-reverse-proxy-page, you see a page similar to what you see on https://proxy.embeddables.com itself.
Pass the ID of your embeddable using the X-Embeddables-Id header.
Verify that you now see the desired embeddable served on your page.
Here's an example Embeddable from GT for you to use: flow_de2b127763j7hijehh3i05cab (edited)  */}
<Steps>
  <Step title="Point your page to our proxy server">
    Point your reverse proxy to: `https://proxy.embeddables.com`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the proxy is pointing to the correct page">
    Verify that by going to https://yourdomain.com/your-reverse-proxy-page, you see a page similar to what you see on https://proxy.embeddables.com itself.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pass the correct embeddable ID">
    Pass the ID of your embeddable using the `X-Embeddables-Id` header.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify that it's working">
    You should now see the desired embeddable served on your page.
  </Step>
</Steps>
