Custom Code blocks provide various bits of context through arguments in the root functions. They are, in order:

| #   | Argument          | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `userData`        | The current User Data                                                                                                        |
| 2   | `helperFunctions` | An object containing various helper functions (see [full list below](#available-helper-functions))                           |
| 3   | `triggerContext`  | An object containing data on what triggered the Computed Field or Action (see [full list below](#available-trigger-context)) |

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Example Computed Field
function result(userData, helperFunctions, triggerContext) {
  ...
}
```

```javascript Example Action
function output(userData, helperFunctions, triggerContext) {
  ...
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Available Helper Functions

### `setUserData(updates: Record<string, unknown>)`

This can be used to update the current User Data.

It accepts a JSON object, which can contain one or more key/value pairs.

It's treated as a subset of data that is merged into the existing User Data, although please note that any nested objects will be replaced not merged.

### `resetUserData()`

This can be used to reset the current User Data to the same value as for a brand new user.

All previous data will be lost.

### `triggerAction(actionId: string)`

This can be used to programmatically trigger an action from custom code.

One common use-case for this is when you want two actions to occur, but need one of them to complete before the other one starts.

<Note>
  This list is not exhaustive - more helper functions will be added to these
  docs soon.
</Note>

## Available Trigger Context variables

<Note>
  **Please note** that `old_user_data` and `new_user_data` currently only
  contain the input keys for the Computed Field, not all of User Data. This may
  change in the future.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Trigger Context for Computed Fields
type TriggerContext = {
  inputs_causing_recompute: string[]; // List of keys of inputs that caused the recompute
  old_input_values: string[]; // List of old values of those inputs (last time this Computed Field was computed)
  new_input_values: string[]; // List of current values of those inputs
  old_user_data: Record<string, unknown>; // Snapshot of User Data from when this Computed Field was last computed
  new_user_data: Record<string, unknown>; // Current value of User Data (identical to the first userData argument)
};
```

```typescript Trigger Context for Actions
type TriggerContext = {
  trigger_type: string; // E.g. 'outputs_onclick'
  trigger_page_id: string; // The page that triggered the Action (if triggered by page change)
  trigger_page_key: string; // The page that triggered the Action (if triggered by page change)
  trigger_component_id: string; // The component that triggered the Action (if triggered by a component)
  trigger_component_key: string; // The component that triggered the Action (if triggered by a component)
};
```
