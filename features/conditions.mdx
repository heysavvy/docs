**Conditions** are one of Embeddable's powerful logic features, and have a variety of use-cases.

A Condition decides whether a page or component is shown or hidden, based on the value of a property in [User Data](/features/user-data).

To set up a Condition, you define which values are acceptable for a User Data property. If the property has those values, then the page or component is shown - if not, then it is hidden.

## Showing/Hiding a component or page with Conditions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Page/Component Options">
    - Select the page or component, in the Layers sidebar or (in the case of a component) in the central preview pane.
    - Make sure you're on the Content tab at the top-left.
    - Click on Options in the tabs at the top of the right-hand sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Condition">
    - Click the `+ Add condition` button.
    - Choose the **key** in User Data that you want to impact whether this page/component is shown or hidden.
    - Choose the type of **operator** for the Condition - usually this is `Is or includes`.
    - Choose the **value** that should make this page/component be shown.

    <Tip>
      The way to think about key, operators and values in a Condition is **like an equation**.
      
      For example, you might want to display a some warning text to users under 18, so the condition is effectively `age_range = 'under_18'`.
      
      Here, `age_range` is the **key**, `Is or includes` is the **operator**, and `under_18` is the **value**.
