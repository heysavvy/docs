**Actions** are a core feature of Embeddables, allowing you to run custom JS code when some kind of event occurs.

Actions are initiated by **Triggers**, which are events that occur in the Embeddable. For example, a Trigger might be when a user clicks a button, or when a page is loaded.

Actions have access to the [User Data](/features/user-data) JSON object, a series of helper functions like `setUserData` and `triggerAction`, and extra context about what triggered the Action.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom code Action">
    - Go to the Logic sidebar and click on the Actions tab.
    - Click `+ Add New Action`.
    - Give it a name like "Send Data to Klaviyo".
    - Hit `Add`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your custom code">
    - Add whatever custom JS you like inside the `output()` function.
    - The first argument of `output()` is the User Data, and the other arguments
      are [described here](/guides/custom-code).
    - The code will execute on the frontend, in the main window environment,
      so has access to window functions and variables.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Action execution environment

Actions are executed client-side, in the main window environment.

This means that they have access to the main window's functions and variables, such as `window.location`, `document`, and `localStorage`.

This can have useful benefits, such as:
1. The ability to manipulate the DOM
2. Access to read and write to `localStorage`
3. Accessing frontend functionality that you might want to expose to the Embeddable, e.g. `window.logInToApp()`.

<Warning>
  **Be careful to avoid exposing secure information such as API Secrets in Actions.**
  
  One workaround for this (which can also solve CORS issues) is to use the Embeddables Proxy API - ask Embeddables for more information on this.

## Example Actions

### Send Data to Backend

Here's an example of an Action that sends a subset of User Data to a backend.

```js
// All Actions must contain a function called output()
function output(userData) {
  // Create an object with the data we want to send
  const dataToSend = {
    email: userData.email,
    name: userData.name,
    favorite_color: userData.favorite_color,
  };

  // Send this data to the backend
  fetch('https://your-backend-url.com/', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(dataToSend),
  });
}
```
