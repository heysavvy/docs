**Actions** are a core feature of Embeddables, allowing you to run custom JS code when some kind of event occurs.

Actions are initiated by **Triggers**, which are events that occur in the Embeddable. For example, a Trigger might be when a user clicks a button, or when a page is loaded.

Actions have access to the [User Data](/features/user-data) JSON object, a series of helper functions like `setUserData` and `triggerAction`, and extra context about what triggered the Action.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom code Action">
    - Go to the Logic sidebar and click on the Actions tab.
    - Click `+ Add New Action`.
    - Give it a name like "Send Data to Klaviyo".
    - Hit `Add`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your custom code">
    - Add whatever custom JS you like inside the `output()` function.
    - The first argument of `output()` is the User Data, and the other arguments
      are [described here](/guides/custom-code).
    - The code will execute on the frontend, in the main window environment,
      so has access to window functions and variables.
