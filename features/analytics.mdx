**Analytics** is baked into Embeddables, and can be captured and analyzed in a variety of ways.

There are various ways to capture analytics in Embeddables:
- Automatically captured analytics
- Custom client-side events
- Custom server-side events
- Conversion events

## Capturing analytics

### Automatically captured analytics

The following analytics are automatically captured and available to analyze:

- The User
  - The entire [User Data](/features/user-data) JSON object is available to be captured.
  - You can control which of the User Data fields are sent to the Embeddables database, vs which are stored locally in the user's browser.
- Events
  - Page views
  - Button Clicks, if you turn the Capature Clicks setting on for that button

### Custom client-side events

You can capture custom events using custom code - it's best to do this in an [Action](/features/actions):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom code Action, with a Trigger on the relevant event">
    - Go to the Logic -> Actions, and click `+ Add New Action`.
    - Give it a name like "Track X event", and hit `Add`.
    - Add a Trigger for the relevant event, such as a button click, attaching the Action to that Trigger.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the `trackCustomEvent()` function">
    - Inside the `output()` function, use the `trackCustomEvent()` function inside the `helperFunctions` argument.
    - The first argument is the name of the event, and the second is a JSON object of properties.
    - For example:
      ```js
      function output(userData, helperFunctions) {
        // Track a custom event, with extra metadata properties
        helperFunctions.trackCustomEvent('got_recommendation', {
          recommendation_id: properties.recommendation_id,
          recommendation_name: properties.recommendation_name
        });
      }
      ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Custom server-side events

Some events will occur somewhere other than in the Embeddable, for example a user completing a doctor's appointment.

To track these events in Embeddables, you can send a server-side event to the Embeddables API. This will then be available to analyze in the Embeddables Web App:

### Conversion events

Conversion events are a special status given to certain events of the other types described above.

Conversion events are defined in the Embeddables Web App, and consist of a name, a type, and specific properties.

Types of conversion events:
- Page View
  - Properties: `page_key`
- Button Click
  - Properties: `button_key`
- Custom Event
  - Properties: `event_name`

Conversions that relate to a page or button in an Embeddable will be shown on the relevant pages in the Pages sidebar.
