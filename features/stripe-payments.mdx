## Keys and IDs that you'll need

- Your Stripe **Publishable Key**
- A **Restricted Key** generated in Stripe, with the following scopes/permissions:
  - `Customers`: `Write`
  - `Payment Intents`: `Write`
  - `Setup Intents`: `Write`
  - `Checkout Session`: `Write`
  - `Credit notes`: `Read`
  - `Subscriptions`: `Write`
- Any **Price IDs** for specific products you want to offer

## Setting up Stripe

The following are the minimum steps required to add a Stripe component to your Embeddable:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate and share the necessary Stripe keys">
    - Get your Publishable Key, and generate a Restricted Key with the scopes/permissions listed above, from the [API Keys section of your Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).
    - Pass these keys to the Embeddables Team (make sure to share the Restricted Key in a secure way).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Stripe component to your Embeddable">
    - In the Builder, switch to the checkout page that should contain the Stripe component.
    - Select a Container to insert the Stripe component into, or a copmonent that it should be added next to.
    - Open the `+` left-hand sidebar, and select `Stripe` from the list of components.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose the type of payment you want to accept">
    - Under Checkout mode, select one of the following options:
      - **Payment**: If you're accepting only one-time payments, or want to place a hold on a user's card.
      - **Setup**: For setting up a user's payment method to take payments in the future.
      - **Subscription**: If your line items will include at least one recurring payment.
    <Note>
      Please note that Stripe only supports placing a hold on one-time payments, not recurring payments.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose which payment methods you want to accept">
    - Under Payment methods, select the payment methods you want to accept, from the following options:
      - **Credit card**
      - **Link** (Stripe's own quick purchase login system)
      - **US Bank Account**
      - **Buy now, pay later services**: Afterpay/Clearpay, Klarna, Affirm
    <Note>
      You need to have the relevant payment methods enabled in your Stripe account in order for them to appear for users.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add line items to the checkout">
    - There are two different types of line item that you can add:
      1. **Price ID**: This corresponds to a product and price that you've already created in Stripe.
      <Warning>
        Make sure to grab the **Price ID** from Stripe, rather than the Product ID.
      </Warning>
      <Accordion title="How to find the Price ID">
        - Go to the [Product Catalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) section of your Stripe Dashboard.
        - Select the product you want to use.
        - Click on the more options (three dots) icon button in the Price that you want to use.
        - Select `Copy price ID`.

        </Frame>
      </Accordion>
      2. **Custom line item**: This lets you manually enter an amount, currency and name for the line item in Embeddables.
    - Both types of line item require you to enter a quantity.
    <Tip>
      If you need your line items to be dynamic (i.e. change based on the user's answers, like what plan they select), see the [Add dynamic line items](#add-dynamic-line-items) section below.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Include the customer email address (and, optionally, phone number)">
    - To insert the user's given email address into the Stripe checkout, add the key name of the component you use to collect the user's email, using **Templating** (e.g. `{{email}}`).
    - You can optionally collect a user's phone number, using the same method.

    <Tip>
      By default, Stripe's credit card fields will also include Country and Zipcode / Postal Code fields.

      These are all Stripe needs for a customer billing address, so you don't need to provide any billing address fields.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Optional: Additional Stripe configurations

These features are not required in order to successfully accept payments, but they can be useful in different scenarios.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Collect shipping information">
    To collect shipping information from the user, you need to make sure you have the relevant input components in your Embeddable:
      - Address Line 1
      - Address Line 2
      - City
      - State
      - Zipcode / Postal Code
      - Country

    Then, enter the keys of these components in the Shipping Address fields in the Stripe component using Templating, e.g. `{{address_line_1}}`.
      
    <Info>
      Shipping information is optional, depending on whether you're sending the customer a physical product.

      Billing information is required, but only country and postal code. This is handled automatically by the Stripe component, as described above, so you don't need to add your own billing address fields.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add dynamic line items">
    Sometimes you need your line items to be dynamic - i.e. change based on the user's answers, such as the plan that they select.

    To do this:
    1. Use a [Computed Field](/features/computed-fields)` to generate the JSON for the line items.
    2. Refernce the key of that Computed Field in the Line Items section of the Stripe component.

    <Note>
      In order for the Stripe component to still work when the Embeddable is in test mode, you need to ensure that the Computed Field handles test mode correctly by returning a test price_id.
    </Note>

    **Example Computed Field code:**

    ```javascript
    // @TODO: Delete one of these based on whether you're charging a recurring or one-time payment
    const TEST_PRICE_ID = 'price_1JMwNRIQ3JVMlttKsvCn3lK3' // This is a recurring Embeddables-provided test price ID
    const TEST_PRICE_ID = 'price_1KGqjRIQ3JVMlttKzJ059opF' // This is a one-time Embeddables-provided test price ID
    // @TODO: Replace these constants
    const PRICE_ID_PLAN_1 = 'price_aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'
    const PRICE_ID_PLAN_2 = 'price_bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb'

    // All Computed Fields must contain a function called result()
    function result(userData) {
      // Determine whether we're in test mode
      const url = new URL(window.location)
      const isTestMode = url.searchParams.get('savvy_test') === 'true'
        || (!url.searchParams.get('savvy_test') && url.searchParams.get('savvy_env'))
        || (!url.searchParams.get('savvy_test') && url.host.endsWith('embeddables.com'))
      const testPriceId = TEST_PRICE_ID

      // Determine which price_id the user has selected
      const selectedPriceId = userData.selected_plan === 'advanced' ? PRICE_ID_PLAN_2 : PRICE_ID_PLAN_1

      // If we're in test mode, use the test price_id, otherwise use the selected product's price_id
      const priceId = isTestMode ? testPriceId : selectedPriceId

      // Return the line items
      return [
        {
          price: priceId, 
          quantity: 1,
        },
      ];
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Place a hold on the customer's card">
    This lets you place a hold on the user's card, which:
      1. Ensures that they have enough funds to cover the cost of the order.
      2. Holds the funds for a certain period of time, to ensure that they're available to complete the payment.

    For more information on how placing a hold works in Stripe, see the [Stripe documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method).
    <Warning>
      **You will need to manually release the hold on the user's card at a later date to complete the payment.**

      This is not handled by Embeddables, since it happens at a later stage when the user is no longer interacting with the Embeddable.
    </Warning>
    <Note>
      Please note that Stripe only supports placing a hold on one-time payments, not recurring payments.

      To achieve the effect of a hold on a recurring payment, some companies set up a one-time payment to cover the cost of the first month, and then add a recurring payment with a delay or free trial.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add a custom success message">
    This lets you customize the message that users see after they complete the payment.

    If the payment fails, for example if the credit card is declined, the error message returned from Stripe will be displayed to the user.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Choose a layout for the Stripe component">
    This lets you choose a layout for the Stripe component, which affects how different payment method options are displayed to the user.
    The following options are available:
      - **Tabs** (default): This displays different payment methods in separate tabs, in a horizontal row across the top of the component.
      - **Accordion**: This displays different payment methods in an accordion of expanded and collapsed sections, with one payment method option open at a time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Trigger actions on payment events">
    You can trigger [Actions](/features/actions) on the following payment events:

    | Event                    | Triggered when                                                    |
    |------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Payment attempted**    | The user clicks the Pay button (regardless of success or failure) |
    | **Payment successful**   | The payment is completed                                          |
    | **Payment failed**       | The payment is declined                                           |

    To do this:
    1. Create a new Action and type the JavaScript code you want to run.
    2. Add a Trigger to the Action that fires on one of the above payment events.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Collect Stripe IDs to send to your backend">
    You can collect the following IDs that Stripe provides when a payment is completed:

    | Stripe ID              | Provided for                                                     |
    | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Customer ID**        | All payment types                                                |
    | **Invoice ID**         | All payments except on-hold payments and collecting card details |
    | **Payment Intent ID**  | One-time payments only                                           |
    | **Subscription ID**    | Recurring payments only                                          |

    #### To collect these IDs:
    1. Specify a User Data key to store the ID in, in the relevant field in the Stripe component options.
    2. Add that key to the Registered Keys in the Embeddable-wide settings.

    #### To send them to your backend:
    1. Set up an Action that's triggered when the payment is completed, as specified above in [Trigger actions on payment events](#trigger-actions-on-payment-events).
    2. Use the relevant keys in `userData`, provided in the Action function's first argument.

    **Example Action code:**

    ```javascript
    // All Actions must contain a function called output()
    // Trigger this Action when the payment is completed
    function output(userData) {
      // Extract the relevant IDs from the userData object
      const { customer_id, invoice_id, subscription_id } = userData;
      console.log(customer_id, invoice_id, subscription_id);

      // Send these IDs to your backend
      fetch('https://your-backend-url.com/', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ customer_id, invoice_id, subscription_id }),
      });
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Store the selected plan/product and payment status in User Data">
    Storing the plan or product that the user selected, and the status of the payment, can be useful when looking at your users' data later, or sending that data to your own backend or CRM.

    The good news is that this information is almost certainly already being stored!

    ### Storing the plan or product

    If you're offering multiple plans or products to the user, then that probably means you're either:
    1. Using an Option Selector component to let the user select the plan or product they want to purchase, or
    2. Using a Computed Field to calculate the appropriate plan or product based on the user's answers.

    In both cases, just make sure that the key you're using to store the plan or product is set to be
    [stored in the 'Embedables Cloud Context'](https://docs.embeddables.com/features/user-data#where-is-user-data-stored%3F) - i.e. stored in Embeddables' database.

    <Tip>
      If you're offering multiple plans or products, you're also probably using a Computed Field to generate the **line items** for the Stripe component, including the price_id(s).

      You can then opt to store this in the 'Embedables Cloud Context' as well.
      
      Alternatively, you can store a simplified version with just the price_id(s), by computing with with another Computed Field.
    </Tip>

    ### Storing the payment status
    
    The payment status is automatically stored  in User Data, using the key of the Stripe component.

    For this reason, we recommend choosing a straightforward key name for the Stripe component, e.g. `stripe_payment`.

    The status will then appear in the User Data as one of the following:
    {/* 'fresh' | 'pending' | 'error' | 'completed' */}

    - `stripe_payment: 'fresh'` - The Stripe checkout has been reset and is ready for another attempt
    - `stripe_payment: 'pending'` - The payment has just been attempted, and is awaiting a success or failure response from Stripe
    - `stripe_payment: 'error'` - The payment failed
    - `stripe_payment: 'completed'` - The payment was successful
