In Embeddables, **User Data** refers to the current data stored on a given user.

User Data exists as a JSON object of properties. These properties could be:
- Answers the user gave to questions (the key would be the input component's key)
- A value calculated by a [Computed Field](/features/computed-fields) (the key would be the computed field's key)
- A value set by an [Experiment](/features/split-testing) (the key would be the experiment's key)
- Other types of properties (see full list below)

## Where is User Data stored?

User Data is stored in three places, or 'contexts', and each one usually stored a different amount of data.

<Tip>
  Contexts are cascading, so if a property is stored in #2, it will also be stored in #1 as well.
</Tip>

1. **Embeddable Context** - This is the full User Data, and is stored within the Embeddable itself. It is not available after the user refreshes or closes the tab.
2. **Local Storage Context** - This is the subset of User Data that is stored in the user's browser, in Local Storage. It's used to remember a user's answers and position in the flow after they close the tab and return later.
3. **Embeddables Cloud Context** - This is the smallest subset of User Data that is stored in Embeddables' databases. It is used for displaying analytics insights in the Embeddables Web App.
