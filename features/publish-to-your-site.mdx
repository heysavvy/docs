There are three ways to publish your Embeddable to your website:

1. [Embed in your site's frontend](#embedding-in-your-site’s-frontend) using the embed code (in raw HTML, [React](/how-to/embed-in-react), or [React Native](/how-to/embed-in-react-native))
2. [Set up a reverse proxy](#setting-up-a-reverse-proxy)
3. [Integrate with your site's backend](#integrating-with-your-site’s-backend-using-the-embeddables-api)


## Embedding in your site's frontend

You can use the 2-part embed code to easily embed your Embeddable in your website or web app:

## Setting up a reverse proxy

Publishing your Embeddable via a reverse proxy can be done in 4 steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Point your page to our proxy server">
    Point your reverse proxy to: `https://proxy.embeddables.com`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the proxy is pointing to the correct page">
    Verify that by going to https://yourdomain.com/your-reverse-proxy-page, you see a page similar to what you see on https://proxy.embeddables.com itself.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pass the correct Embeddable ID">
    Pass the ID of your Embeddable using the `X-Embeddables-Id` header.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add metadata headers (optional)">
    You can customize the page metadata by adding these optional headers:
    
    - `X-Embeddables-Title`: Sets the page title
    - `X-Embeddables-Description`: Sets the page meta description
    - `X-Embeddables-Favicon`: Sets the page favicon URL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify that it's working">
    You should now see the desired Embeddable served on your page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integrating with your site's backend using the Embeddables API

You can also integrate directly with the Embeddables API from your site's backend, to serve an Embeddable using Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

<Tip>
  This integration currently requires a technical conversation with the Embeddables team to discuss your tech stack and how the integration would work, and to enable this for your account.
