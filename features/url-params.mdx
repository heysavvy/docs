## How to use URL params in Emebddables

1. The following URL params are available for use on both Embeddables preview links and live URLs on your own site. They aren't available for use on the Builder or Web App.
2. The key of the param can differ, depending on whether it's on a preview link (e.g. `https://preview.embeddables.com/flow_abcdefg?version=latest`) or a live link (e.g. `https://mywebsite.com/?savvy_flow_version=latest`).

## List of available URL params

<Info>
  Some of these params start with "savvy" or "savvy_flow" - Savvy is the old
  name for Embeddables before we changed our brand. We'll be updating these
  soon!
