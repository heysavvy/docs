Embeddables provides a set of features to help you ensure that your data is HIPAA compliant. This guide outlines the main steps and best practices for maintaining HIPAA compliance in your workspace.

<Tip>
  The **Compliance** tab in the sidebar of the Embeddables Web App contains a complete checklist of all the steps you need to take to be fully HIPAA compliant.

  We strongly recommend completing all the steps in the checklist to ensure that your workspace is fully HIPAA compliant.
</Tip>

### 1. Set Your Team Permissions

Properly configuring your team’s roles and permissions is the foundation of HIPAA compliance. For a full overview of roles and permissions, see [User Roles & Permissions](./user-roles-permissions.mdx).

- **Assign a Data Privacy Officer**: Designate a single, trusted team member as your Data Privacy Officer. This person will be responsible for managing data privacy settings and completing the HIPAA checklist.
- **Restrict Access to De-Anonymized Data**: Only grant Full Data Access to users who have a clear, documented need to view personally identifiable or health information. All other users should have Anonymized Data Access.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically review team roles and permissions to ensure they remain appropriate as your team or requirements change.

### 2. Label Health Data and Personally Identifiable Data Fields

For each live Embeddable, you must label which fields count as:
- **Health Data** (Protected Health Information, PHI)
- **Personally Identifiable Data** (PII)
- **Contact Info** (e.g., email, phone number)

<Note>
When defining field types, we recommend that the Data Privacy Officer be familiar with the following document:

[Guidance Regarding Methods for De-identification of Protected Health Information](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html)

This guidance will help you determine what counts as identifiable health information and how to properly de-identify data.
</Note>


This labeling determines which users can access sensitive data and ensures that data is handled according to HIPAA requirements.

- The Data Privacy Officer is responsible for defining these fields for each Embeddable.
- Data that is not correctly labeled will be hidden from all users except those with Full Data Access.

<Warning>
**Make sure that your list of live (published) Embeddables is up-to-date.**

Use this list as your checklist of Embeddables for which you need to label fields.

</Warning>


### 4. Ongoing Responsibility

HIPAA compliance is not a one-time task. The Data Privacy Officer must ensure that:
- All new Embeddables are reviewed and labeled appropriately before going live.
- Existing Embeddables are kept up-to-date as fields or data requirements change.
- Team permissions are regularly reviewed and updated as needed.

By following these steps and best practices, you can help ensure that your workspace remains HIPAA compliant and that sensitive data is protected according to regulatory requirements.
