In your workspace, each user is assigned two key attributes that determine what they can do and what data they can access:

## Summary of Roles & Permissions

- **Role**: Controls editing, publishing, and management capabilities.
  - **Admin**: Full editing and publishing access.
  - **Publisher**: Can save and push Embeddables live.
  - **Editor**: Can save Embeddables, but **cannot** push them live.
- **Data Access Level**: Controls what end-user data the person can see.
  - **Data Privacy Officer**: Full access to all end-user data.
  - **Full Data Access**: Can access all end-user data, including personally identifiable information (PII/PHI).
  - **Anonymized Data Access**: Can only access anonymized data - end-user's personally identifiable + health info is hidden.

## Full Guide to Roles & Permissions


### 1. Roles

Roles define what actions a user can take within the system. There are three main roles:

#### **Admin**
- Full editing and publishing access.
- Can manage other users' roles and data access permissions.
- Recommended for team leads or those responsible for overall workspace management.

#### **Publisher**
- Can save and push Embeddables live.
- Cannot manage other users.
- Suitable for users who need to publish changes but do not require admin privileges.

#### **Editor**
- Can save Embeddables, but **cannot** push them live.
- Ideal for content creators or team members who prepare changes for review.



### 2. Data Access Levels

Data Access Levels determine what kind of end-user data a person can view. There are three levels:

#### **Data Privacy Officer**
- Full access to all end-user data.
- Responsible for defining which fields contain sensitive information.
- **There should be only one person with this role**—this person sets the rules for the rest of your team.

#### **Full Data Access**
- Can access all end-user data, including personally identifiable information (PII/PHI).
- Assign to team members who need the full set of customer data to do their job.

#### **Anonymized Data Access**
- Can only access anonymized data—personally identifiable information about end-users is hidden.
- This is the **safest** form of access and is recommended for most users.

## Best Practices

- Assign the **Data Privacy Officer** role to a single, trusted team member who understands privacy requirements.
- Use **Anonymized Data Access** for most users to minimize risk and exposure to sensitive data.
- Only grant **Full Data Access** to those who absolutely need it for their work.
- Regularly review user roles and data access levels to ensure they are up to date and appropriate for each team member's responsibilities.
