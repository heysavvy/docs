Embeddables uses **Local Storage** to persist User Data within the browser, so that when a user refreshes or returns later, they can pick up where they left off.

Local Storage is similar to Cookies, but has a few key differences which are described below.

## Local Storage in Embeddables

As described in our [User Data](/features/user-data) documentation, Embeddables stores user data in multiple contexts.

In the Embeddables Builder, you can choose which context to store each value, on a field-by-field basis.

The three contexts are:

1. **Embeddable Context**: In-memory storage that exists only during the current session.
2. **Local Storage Context**: Persistent browser storage that remains after tab/browser closure. *(Data stored here is also stored in #1).*
3. **Embeddables Cloud Context**: Data stored on our servers to provide the analytics insights in the Embeddables Web App. *(Data stored here is also stored in #1 and #2).*

## Local Storage vs Cookies

### Comparison table

| Feature | Local Storage | Cookies |
| ------- | ------------- | ------- |
| **Storage Capacity** | 5-10MB | 4KB |
| **Expiration** | Doesn't expire automatically | Can be set to expire |
| **Sent with Requests** | No, stays in browser | Yes, sent with every HTTP request |
| **Accessibility** | Same-origin only | Can be configured for cross-origin |
| **Manipulation** | JavaScript only | JavaScript or HTTP headers |

### Duration of Storage

Data stored in Local Storage persists until:
- The user manually clears their browser data/cache
- The user uses private/incognito browsing
- The user switches to a different browser or device

Unlike cookies, Local Storage doesn't have built-in expiration mechanisms. This allows Embeddables to maintain a consistent user experience even if users return to your embeddable weeks or months later.

### Privacy Considerations

Local Storage is generally considered more privacy-friendly than cookies because:
- It's not automatically sent with HTTP requests
- It's limited to the domain that created it
- It doesn't support the tracking capabilities that third-party cookies enable
