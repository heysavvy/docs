## Use-cases

Some common use-cases that we often see:

1. I want to send data to an external SaaS app (e.g. a CRM, Airtable).
2. I want to trigger an email to be sent to me, or to the end-user.
3. I want to send data to my own backend/API.
4. I want to fetch content to display in my embeddable, similar to a CMS.
5. ...many other combinations of the above...

## Questions to ask yourself

If you're sending data somewhere:

- Am I sending to an external SaaS app, or to my own backend/database/API?
- Am I sending the data somewhere to access later, or will I need to access it instantly to avoid blocking the end-user?
- Am I sending data to a domain that might be blocked by browsers or ad blockers?
- Will I need to include some kind of private API key or token in the request?

If you're fetching data from somewhere:

- Do I need the content to load instantly on page load, or later (e.g. on a subsequent page, or after a button click)?
- Does the data need to be secure, or is it public data that it's OK for people to access?
- Am I fetching data from a domain that might be blocked by browsers or ad blockers?
