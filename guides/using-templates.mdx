Embeddables templates are a great way to get started and go live in a matter of days not weeks.

<Tip>
**Ask the Embeddables team for advice on what templates are available** to match your industry, product catalog and other specific needs.

</Tip>

## Quickstart

The following is a list of things that must be modified once you've cloned from a template.

1. **Stripe Component & Computed Field**

   - Update product_data CF with product info.
   - Configure the Stripe component in the **Options** tab.

2. **POST Tellescope Action**

   - Requires `apikey`, `formid`, and `endpoint`.
     - Endpoint is preconfigured with Tellescope.
     - API key and form ID come from credentials in the webapp.

3. **Fetch Headers**

   - **Project ID** → Embeddables project number (`pr_123` in builder URL).
   - **Environment** → must match both fetch and credentials.

4. **Webapp Configuration (Settings → Credentials & Endpoints)**

   - **Stripe**: Create a new Stripe credential (type + environment).
   - **Tellescope**: Create a Custom Credential:
     - Type: EHR
     - Service: Tellescope
     - Key Type: API key
     - Environment: desired one
   - **Endpoint**:
     - Environment must match credentials.
     - Add regex URLs:
       - **Allowed Origins** → embedding URL.
       - **Allowed Destinations** → Tellescope API.
     - Link the Credential ID.

  <Accordion title="Medvi Template">

    **Card & Actions**

    - The button on the product card that’s on the checkout page triggers an **Action**. (there’s one for each specific card button, Semaglutide value and Tirzepatide value)
    - This Action sets **UserData** with the selected product and slides to the **Stripe** component.

    **Product Data & Stripe**

    - product_data is a **Computed Field (CF)** that stores all products. These are saved in **UserData** and passed to **Stripe** via their price_id.
    - stripe_line_items is another CF that retrieves the price_id from product_data (based on the environment) and passes it to Stripe.
    - The Stripe component is configured in the **Options tab**, where the template value stripe_line_items is already loaded. Several inputs are linked via their **keys**.

    **Payment Complete → POST Tellescope**

    - When payment is complete, the **POST Tellescope** Action is triggered.
    - This Action contains a **template** with a pre-set answers object that is sent as payload to Tellescope.
    - The answers are linked to builder components via their keys.
    - The Action also requires **apikey**, **formid**, and **endpoint**:
        - The **endpoint** is already configured with Tellescope information.
        - The **apikey** and **formid** are set up through **credentials** in the webapp (where we paste their template values).

    **Headers in the Fetch**

    - In the **fetch** (specifically in the headers), two values must be filled/replaced:
        - **Project ID** → matches the Embeddables project number (found in the builder URL as pr_123).
        - **Environment** → must match the environment used for the fetch and the one defined in the credentials.

    **Configuration in the Webapp (Settings → Credentials & Endpoints)**

    - In the webapp, the last option in the side menu is **Settings**. Inside, go to the **Credentials & Endpoints** tab to configure **Stripe** and **Tellescope**.
    - **Stripe Credentials**:
        - The first option is for Stripe.
        - By clicking **New Stripe Credential**, you can create new credentials by providing **type** and **environment**.
    - **Custom Credentials (Tellescope)**:
        - The second option is **Custom Credentials**, where we configure the credentials for Tellescope.
        - Click **New Custom Credential** and provide:
            - **Type**: EHR (for Tellescope).
            - **Service Name**: Tellescope.
            - **Key Type**: API key.
            - **Environment**: the desired one.
    - **Endpoints**:
        - Finally, configure an endpoint by clicking **New Endpoint**.
        - The **environment** of the endpoint must match the one from the credentials.
        - Two URLs in **regex** format must be filled:
            - **Allowed Origins** → the URL where the flow is embedded (where the fetch will be executed).
            - **Allowed Destinations** → the URL of the Tellescope API.
        - The **Credential ID** must be the one configured in the previous step.

    **Option Selector & Product Data**

    - On the **checkout page**, there is an **option selector** with 4 default products.
    - The **keys** of these options match and connect the option selector with the products defined in a **Computed Field (CF)** called product_data.
    - This way, when a user selects an option, that product is stored in the **UserData**.
