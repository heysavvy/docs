#### End-User

_Note: Also known as a [Contact](#contact)._

This is a real life person who is currently viewing/completing, or has previously viewed/completed, one of your embeddables.

This is distinct from an Embeddables User, which is someone who builds embeddables in our builder - like you!

#### User Data

_Note: Also known as an [Entry](#entry)._

This is the set of data that an [end-user](#end-user) of an embeddable has at any time, for example their email address or the answer they gave to a question.

It is stored in `JSON` format and the schema is dependent on the embeddable that they are using.

A user that has taken multiple embeddables will have a different User Data for each one. In our database, this is known as one [Contact](#contact) corresponding to multiple [Entries](#entry).
