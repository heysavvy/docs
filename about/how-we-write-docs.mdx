## Who writes these docs?

Our CTO, Jeremy, writes most of the docs, especially the initial ones.

This ensures that we have not only a consistent styles but a coherent strategy for how we structure and write our documentation.

## How does everyone else contribute?

Everyone else on the Embeddables team contributes in the following ways:

### 1. Feedback + Suggestions

- Giving feedback on docs.
- Suggesting what docs are needed / need expanding.
- Suggesting changes to the structure.

### 2. What they're working on

- Notifying when they update or add a feature and the relevant docs need to be updated.
- This means that while product builders are not responsible for writing those docs, they _are_ responsible for making sure that things they build always come with up-to-date docs - by asking Jeremy to write/update them.

### 3. Creating authored docs

- Writing an "authored doc", which means we include the name and photo of who wrote the doc at the very top.
- This could be a text-based doc, or a Loom video, or (ideally) both.
- On something that they have a connection to (they built the feature / pioneered this use-case / built a great example / love this use-case or feature).
