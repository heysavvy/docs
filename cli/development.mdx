## Development server

**`embeddables dev`** compiles your TSX (and styles, config, computed fields, actions) and runs a **local proxy** that:

- Serves the compiled Embeddable to the Engine at the **Preview URL**.
- Watches files under `embeddables/<id>/` and recompiles on change (hot reload).
- By default uses the **production** Engine (`https://engine.embeddables.com`); use `--local` to point to a local engine (e.g. `http://localhost:8787`).

The terminal prints a URL like:

`http://localhost:3000?id=<embeddable-id>&version=latest`

Open it in a browser to see your Embeddable. The dev server needs **internet** when using the default (remote) engine.

### Workbench (debugging)

The **Workbench** is a debugging panel for easily changing pages, inspecting user data, computed fields, and actions.

- On **localhost** previews (from `embeddables dev`), the Workbench is **on by default**.
- To hide it, add `?workbench=false` to the URL.
- On **non-localhost** preview links (e.g. shared or deployed URLs), add `?workbench=true` to show the Workbench.
- It is injected by the dev proxy so you can debug without deploying.

## Authoring with TypeScript

Page and global-component files are React (TSX). Import primitives from `@embeddables/cli/components` for autocomplete and correct props:

```tsx
import {
  Container,
  InputBox,
  PlainText,
  CustomButton,
} from "@embeddables/cli/components";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Container id="main" key="main" container_type="container">
      <PlainText id="title" key="title" text="Welcome!" />
      <InputBox
        id="email"
        key="email"
        input_type="email"
        label="Email"
        placeholder="you@example.com"
        isRequired
      />
      <CustomButton
        id="submit"
        key="submit"
        text="Continue"
        action="next-page"
      />
    </Container>
  );
}
```

- **IDs and keys**: Each component needs a unique `id` and `key`. Keys must not start with a digit (use a prefix like `option_` or `range_` if needed).
- **Button actions**: Use `"next-page"` and `"prev-page"` (with `-page`), not `"next"` or `"prev"`.
- Types and stubs live in `.types/` (created by `init`) so your editor can resolve `@embeddables/cli/components` and `@embeddables/cli/types` without installing the CLI as a project dependency.

## For technical developers

- **Comparing changes**: Use `embeddables diff` to compare your local working files against the last saved cloud version (`embeddables diff` with no extra arguments defaults to `--from latest --to local`). For a deeper look, pass `--depth props` to see individual prop changes, or `--page <key>` / `--component <key>` to filter to specific pages or components. You can also compare two cloud versions directly (e.g. `embeddables diff --from 46 --to 47`). For a raw JSON diff, open `embeddable.json` and the latest `embeddable-<branch>@<version>.json` in `.generated/` (e.g. `embeddable-main@47.json`) side by side in VS Code or Cursor: **Shift+click** both files, then **right-click → Compare Selected**.
- **Branches**: Use `embeddables branch` to switch branches; branch/version are stored in `config.json`. CLI-only branches can exist that aren't editable in the Builder; the Builder remains the merge point for production.
- **Save conflicts**: `embeddables save` uses the version in `config.json` (or `.generated/`) for optimistic concurrency. If the server has a newer version, you'll be prompted; resolve by pulling the latest or force-saving when appropriate.
- **Custom engine**: Use `embeddables dev --local` or `--engine <url>` for local or custom Engine origins.
- **Build only**: Run `embeddables build -i <id>` to compile to `.generated/embeddable.json` without saving; then optionally `embeddables save --skip-build`.

## Best practices

1. **Save frequently** (e.g. every 10 minutes or after significant edits) to avoid large conflicts.
2. **Use the Builder** to diff and review after saving from the CLI; helps catch translation or styling differences.
3. **Test in both** local preview (`embeddables dev`) and (when applicable) live/staging to catch environment-specific issues.
4. **Use Workbench** (on by default for localhost previews from `embeddables dev`; use `?workbench=true` on non-localhost links) to inspect user data, computed fields, and actions while debugging.
5. **Use `--fix`** on pull or build if you need to recover from missing required props (removes invalid components with a warning).
