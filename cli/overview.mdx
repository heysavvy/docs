<Warning>

  **The Embeddables CLI is currently in Beta.**

  Use it with caution, update the
  package frequently, and always check the JSON diff before saving, merging or
  pushing to production.

</Warning>

<Info>
  **Current version: 0.9.5** — See the [CLI Changelog](/reference/changelog/cli-changelog) for what's new.
</Info>

The Embeddables CLI lets you build, edit, and manage Embeddables using **code** instead of (or alongside) the web Builder. It turns Embeddables into **TypeScript/TSX** you can edit in any editor, with **hot reload** and strong support for **AI assistants** (Cursor, Claude, etc.).

<Info>
  **Who is this for?** Both **technical developers** (full control, scripts, CI)
  and **non-technical builders** who "vibe-code" with AI: the CLI gives you a
  clear file structure and prompts so AI can edit pages, styles, and logic
  reliably.
</Info>

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0

## Installation

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @embeddables/cli
```

Check your version:

```bash
embeddables -v
```

## Upgrading

When a new CLI version is released:

```bash
embeddables upgrade
```

This installs the latest stable version from npm.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Log in (applies globally)
embeddables login

# 2. Create a project folder for your Embeddables project and go into it
mkdir my-embeddable-project
cd my-embeddable-project

# 3. Initialize from inside that folder (creates config, types, embeddables/ with subfolders per Embeddable)
embeddables init

# 4. Pull an Embeddable (interactive list if logged in)
embeddables pull

# 5. Start the dev server with hot reload
embeddables dev
```

After `embeddables pull`, you'll have TSX pages, styles, computed fields, and actions on disk. After `embeddables dev`, open the **Preview URL** in your browser; edits to files will recompile and refresh automatically.

## Project Structure

Run **`embeddables init`** from inside a project folder you've created for your Embeddables project. That folder will hold **all** Embeddables for that project—the CLI creates an `embeddables/` directory and, as you pull, one subfolder per Embeddable (e.g. `embeddables/<embeddable-id>/`).

`embeddables init` creates (or updates) project-level files. `embeddables pull` adds one folder per Embeddable under `embeddables/`:

```
my-project/
├── embeddables.json          # Project ID and org (from init)
├── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript/JSX config (created by init, or patched to add type paths if it already exists)
├── .types/                   # Type stubs for editor autocomplete (no npm install needed)
├── .gitignore                # Updated to ignore .generated/ and node_modules/
├── .cursor/rules/            # Cursor AI rules (optional, from init)
├── .claude/                  # Claude project context (optional, from init)
├── AGENTS.md                 # Codex context (optional, from init)
└── embeddables/
    └── <embeddable-id>/
        ├── pages/                    # One .page.tsx file per page
        ├── global-components/       # Shared components (e.g. before_page.location.tsx)
        ├── styles/                  # CSS (e.g. index.css)
        ├── computed-fields/         # Custom computed field logic (.js)
        ├── actions/                 # Data output / action handlers (.js)
        ├── config.json              # Embeddable metadata, page list, version
        ├── metadata.json            # Title and basic info
        └── .generated/              # Compiled JSON (used by dev/save; avoid editing)
            ├── embeddable.json      # Current compiled output
            └── embeddable-<branch>@<version>.json   # Saved versions (for comparison)
```

- **Pages**: `pages/<pageKey>.page.tsx` — React components built from Embeddable primitives.
- **Global components**: One file per location (e.g. `before_page.location.tsx`, `after_components.location.tsx`).
- **config.json**: Holds page keys, version, branch info; the compiler merges this with the compiled pages/styles/actions/computed fields.

## Commands

The CLI provides commands for setup, daily workflow, building, and debugging. Here's a quick overview:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `embeddables login` | Log in to your Embeddables account. |
| `embeddables init` | Initialize a project folder with config, types, and AI context. |
| `embeddables pull` | Fetch an Embeddable from the cloud and reverse-compile to TSX. |
| `embeddables dev` | Start the dev server with hot reload. |
| `embeddables save` | Build and upload the Embeddable to the cloud. |
| `embeddables branch` | Switch to a different branch, then pull that branch. |
| `embeddables build` | Compile TSX to JSON without uploading. |
| `embeddables inspect` | Round-trip compile and compare outputs for debugging. |

## Using the CLI with AI

The CLI is built for **AI-assisted editing**. Running `embeddables init` injects context files for **Cursor**, **Claude**, and **Codex** so AI assistants understand Embeddable components, keys, and conventions out of the box.
