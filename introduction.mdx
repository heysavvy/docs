## Getting started

If you're new here, we recommend one of the following two things:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="10-min Quickstart Tutorial"
    icon="pen-to-square"
    href="/tutorials/quickstart"
  >
    Learn the basics while building an embeddable in ten minutes or less.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Guide to the Builder" icon="image" href="/guide">
    This guide walks you through the Builder and its main features.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Diving deeper: how to find what you're looking for

Beyond the above getting started materials, we recommend jumping to a different section, depending on what you're trying to achieve.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Features" icon="palette" href="/guide">
    Here you'll find a page for each feature of Embeddables - have a browse to
    get a feel for what the platform is capabale of.
  </Card>
  <Card title="How-Tos" icon="code" href="/how-tos">
    These help you achieve one specific thing that you're trying to do - they
    assume some general knowledge of the Builder.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tutorials" icon="screwdriver-wrench" href="/tutorials">
    These are longer than How-Tos and involve building something more complete,
    while teaching you how to get the most out of the platform.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reference" icon="list" href="/reference">
    This is where you can look up all the details of a particular concept, or a
    specific feature or sub-feature.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Accordian>
  <Card title="Guide to the Builder" icon="signs-post" href="/guide">
    Great if you're new: this walks you through the Builder as a whole, taking
    you through the main features, what they can do, and how to use them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="About these docs" icon="circle-info" href="/reference">
    Here you can dive into exactly what the purpose of these docs is, and how we
    approach writing them.
