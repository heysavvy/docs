## Getting started

If you're new here, we recommend one of the following two things:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="10-min Quickstart Tutorial"
    icon="pen-to-square"
    href="/tutorials/quickstart"
  >
    Learn the basics while building an embeddable in ten minutes or less.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Guide to the Builder"
    icon="image"
    href="/guide"
  >
    This guide walks you through the Builder and its main features.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to use these docs

We recommend jumping to a different section, depending on what you're trying to achieve.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Guide to the Builder"
    icon="palette"
    href="/guide"
  >
     Great if you're new: this walks you through the Builder as a whole, taking you through the main features, what they can do, and how to use them.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="How-Tos"
    icon="code"
    href="/how-tos"
  >
    These help you achieve one specific thing that you're trying to do - they assume some general knowledge of the Builder.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Tutorials"
    icon="screwdriver-wrench"
    href="/tutorials"
  >
    These are longer than How-Tos and involve building something more complete, while teaching you how to get the most out of the platform.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Reference"
    icon="stars"
    href="/reference"
  >
    This is where you can look up all the details of a particular concept, or a specific feature or sub-feature.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
